 MAR_Regent_council:0 "Regency Council"
 POLITICS_REGENCY_DESC:0 "The Regency Council is an organization formed after the sudden death of Tsar Sergei Belozersky. Although the situation is slowly spiraling out of control, radicals, rebellions, and disputes within the council may soon put an end to a united Russia."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_F_DESC:0 "The sleepless nights of recent months have taken a toll on Tsar Belozersky's health, but they were not the cause of his pitiful state. Hundreds of thousands of ruined lives now weigh on his conscience like holographic marks on a card. Those he failed to save, those who died in his fool's crusade, those he left behind on his path to the throne... All these sacrifices were in vain. He is the murderer of Russian hope.\n\nUsually, such a burden leads one to choose between the bottle and the noose. Sergei Sergeyevich, to his shame, chose the bottle. Shame fuels his endless binges, and the desire to escape this bitter feeling drives him to take another shot. There is no escape from oblivion. Only endless cycles of guilt."
 POLITICS_RUTSKOJ_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Despair. Bargaining. Finally, Rage.\n\nThese were the emotions Alexander Rutskoy felt as he watched reports from the fronts of the new Patriotic War. Russian boys died under bombings and artillery fire due to the incompetence of the Young Russian command, while Rutskoy was forced to deal with the problems of steppe savages. Last time, he was just a child, but now he will try to save Russia from itself. Once again.\n\nThis time, Sanya the Mad will not trust freeloader bureaucrats or useless nobles. §RThe country will be in his hands, and it will be stronger than ever. No matter the cost.§!"
 POLITICS_BEK_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Had he known how things would turn out, Kazem-Bek might never have organized the Mladorossy, continuing instead to write books about religion and longing for a lost Russia. But he couldn’t—and to be honest, he was unable to. Longing for the Motherland.\n\nBy betraying his country and joining Tsar Vladimir’s forces, Alexander sealed his fate. As Russia unified and grew stronger, he forgot his deeds. But as always, the road to hell was paved with good intentions.\n\nNow the leader of the Mladorossy sits in Berezniki, depressed and broken, unsure of what to do next. His heart grows weaker each day, and hope dwindles. Yet now he sits like a true tsar on a throne of swords, ruling his kingdom of ashes."
 POLITICS_BEYRLE_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Joseph Beyrle’s life can be described as a series of disasters and betrayals. When victory seemed within his grasp, fate destroyed that dream, then did so again in the West Russian War. Beyrle seemed to find his place when he joined the Mladorossy. Rising to become the beloved general of Tsar Belozersky, he became the spearhead meant to shatter the European colossus...\n\nAll turned to dust in an instant. Now the Tsar-General is dead, and his general is certain that the only culprit is Kazem-Bek, head of the traitorous Mladorossy. Beyrle no longer cares about Russia’s fate or the necessary sacrifices. His goal is to clear the name of his comrade-in-arms, avenge the Tsar’s murderers, and allow Belozersky’s descendants to rule Russia... Whatever it may be."
 POLITICS_GIL_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Memories are shattered, and the truth will never be told. Gil himself seems to have forgotten his name, forgotten why he is here. By betraying his homeland thirty years ago, he chose his path. People around him kept dying, and situations flipped upside down. First the Reds, then the Germans, then the Reds again, Tsar Vladimir’s forces, and finally the Mladorossy. Time and again, he thought he had grasped fate by the tail and finally won. Yet each time, fate proved it could jest.\n\nPerhaps during the Second West Russian War, when Gil’s headquarters came under artillery fire, Vladimir truly died, his mind extinguished amidst machine-gun fire, battlefield screams, and endless shelling. Yet despite this, the general’s body marched on, defying fate, defying the world, defying all reason.\n\nAnd it has no intention of stopping."
 POLITICS_JARUZELSKI_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "A Russian will never be a Pole’s ally—this is the truth Jaruzelski learned through bitter experience. Vladimir Gil, taking command of the Polish Legion, nearly buried it in a single battle. Arkhangelsk clearly wasn’t worth it; everyone knew the battle was lost, and Gil knew it.\n\nNow Wojciech finds himself in a difficult position, surrounded by Kazakhs and bloodthirsty Russians. It seems they haven’t had enough spilled blood. But he will not let Poland slip away or fall into enemy hands.\n\nNew Poland is not yet lost."

 TaS_RUS_shattered_ambitions_desc: "Once again, the Russians tried to unite, and once again, foreign powers defeated them. Some warlords managed to restore control over their fiefdoms, but they rule over people broken in body and spirit. Decades will pass before they approach their former might."

 MAR_Vitaliy_Mukha:0 "Vitaliy Mukha"
 POLITICS_MUKHA_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "After all that Russia endured in the 20th century, Vitaliy Mukha seems like a man from another world. A pen pal of Boris Yeltsin, he lived as a bureaucrat in the monstrous belly of Novosibirsk. With constant changes in power, little changed except the banners above his workplace and the modifications to the AKs of his racketeers. By age thirty-five, he had grown weary of it. Fortunately, the 'Steppe Development' program—de facto Russification of Kazakh bureaucracy—fell into his lap. Life flowed just as slowly, but more stable. He felt that in Kazakhstan, he was not just a cog.\n\nBut stability is the least stable thing. Following the Russian defeat in the European campaign came mass uprisings, political infighting, chaos. Then it all fell silent when Rutskoy’s military mandate in the south stirred. Ironically, the pinnacle of the new republic was reached by none other than Mukha. This small man faces a great task: to protect the people of Kazakhstan from any threat and restore the stability he so loves. Firmly and clearly."
 
 MAR_Evgeny_Primakov:0 "Evgeny Primakov"
 POLITICS_PRIMAKOV_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Evgeny probably can’t recall a time in his life when things were calm—maybe five years ago or even less. But what difference does it make now? Former governor of Tyumen Oblast, he is now the first president of the Tyumen Republic.\n\nIn these difficult times, he vowed to protect his people from the Tsarists in the West, the madmen in the East, and, of course, the general who killed hundreds of thousands to save himself. Russia may be lost, but hope remains. Tyumen will be saved, and then the entire Urals."
 
 MAR_Mintimer_Shaymiev:0 "Mintimer Shaymiev"
 POLITICS_SHAYMIEV_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "This hour has come again—Russia lies in ruins due to its own stupidity. In trying to reclaim its past, it lost everything: people, integrity. The Russian spirit itself seems broken after this war.\n\nShaymiev knows it is time to act. Just a few months ago, he was a simple soldier who miraculously survived the meat grinder on the Western Front. Now he is the first president of the Idel-Ural Republic. A hero to the common people and savior of the Tatar and Bashkir nations. But there’s no time to relax—the enemy is still strong, and the Russians, even in their death throes, may still try to erase independent Idel-Ural.\n\nLet them try. There’s room enough for all."
 
 MAR_Dmitry_Vasilyev:0 "Dmitry Vasilyev"
 POLITICS_VASILYEV_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Dmitry Vasilyev was not a particularly outstanding man. He survived the Russian anarchy fairly well and even initially welcomed the Mladorossy’ rise to power. The return of the Tsar, the revival of old traditions—it seemed the hour had finally come for Russia to rise again and show the world. But... it was not to be.\n\nDima knew this day would come. You can’t mix autocracy, the essence of the Russian nation, and godless socialism that led to collapse. In the end, the Mladorossy learned this the hard way. Tens of thousands lie in the cold ground, hundreds more gravely wounded, and no one will save them now. Russia got its due, turning away from God. But there is still a chance to fix everything."
 
 MAR_Susanna_Pechuro:0 "Susanna Pechuro"
 POLITICS_PECHURO_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "History does not tolerate the subjunctive mood, and this is a fact one must accept. Of course, Susanna sometimes indulges in daydreams—of a world where the USSR did not lose the war to the Reich, where the Union remained a great power. But now, now that’s irrelevant.\n\nReturning to reality, one must remember much: that Buryatia lies in ruins, that Russia has lost again, and that she is effectively a vassal to a very ambitious general with an army of mercenaries. But what does it matter? One must cling to any opportunity."
 
 MAR_Mikhail_Nikolayev:0 "Mikhail Nikolayev"
 POLITICS_NIKOLAYEV_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "To be honest, Mikhail never dreamed of being a national leader. What nonsense! A peaceful life always appealed to him more. But when war engulfed the Far East with renewed force, he couldn’t stand aside.\n\nNow he sits amid icy wastelands—the Mladorossy never repaired anything—surrounded by mercenaries, reindeer, and scattered communes, prodded by a mercenary commander from the East. Life sure knows how to surprise."
 
 MAR_Vladimir_Zhirinovsky:0 "Vladimir Zhirinovsky" 
 POLITICS_ZHIRIK_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "The 'Jackal of Iraq,' as he was dubbed by Middle Easterners, returned to Russia in her darkest hour. Blinded by ambition, she flew too close to the sun and burned to ashes. But Vladimir Volfovich wouldn’t be himself without a plan to fix everything.\n\nNow Zhirinovsky has a great army: mercenaries, Russian peacekeepers, and people who decided to help Russia in her hour of need, just as she helped them not long ago. And, of course, the most powerful ally—the dollar of Uncle Sam—backs the leader of the Far Eastern Republic. In another time, this would be just another dirty bill, but now all means are valid.\n\nA patriot’s hardened spirit cannot be broken. Russia will be free!"
 
 MAR_Kessler_Heinz:0 "Heinz Kessler" 
 POLITICS_KESSLER_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "For a long time, Heinz Kessler considered himself a staunch communist, looking with awe at the Soviet Union. He greeted the Nazis' rise to power coldly and with contempt. Because of this, Heinz voluntarily surrendered to the Soviet side during the Great Patriotic War.\n\nHowever, the hopes he had harbored from the results of this war were destroyed. The USSR fell under the blows of the German military machine. The dream of many workers of that time was shattered. And Kessler also questioned the ideals he had believed in for so long.\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a staff officer in Kazakhstan. And because of his geographical location, Heinz was unable to take part in the first West Russian War. However, after the unification of Russia, he managed to join the armed forces of the Russian Empire, reaching great heights.\n\nDuring the Second West Russian War, Heinz Kessler led an army made up of German collaborators and prisoners of war who agreed to participate in the war on the side of Russia. But personal successes turned out to be nothing compared to the horrors brought by Russia's defeat.\n\nDespite all the efforts made in the conflict, Kessler and his subordinate combat units were accused by the center of deliberate sabotage. This eventually led to the formation of the German Free Army, which seized a number of Volga territories and severed any ties with the now former center.\n\nAnd it was in this difficult situation that Heinz Kessler found himself, now forced to hold power in his hands, for which he was not ready."

Countless bloody revolutions, the execution of the royal family, civil wars, and defeats—each costing us unbearable losses. Nevertheless, despite everything, we keep moving forward. Each time it gets harder—old wounds haven’t healed, and new ones already appear. But we refuse to surrender. We are so strong that our anger will finally catch up with our enemies.\n\nRussia is again defeated and dismembered. Young Russian ideas failed our people, just as Tsarism and Marxism did in their time. However, this time we refuse to remain idle. Let people call it a civil war or the Third Smuta—we will forge a united Motherland."

In the 1940s, Bukharin lost the Second World War to the Reich, resulting in the loss of Moscow. In the 1950s, the WRRF, although losing the West Russian War, came closer to victory than ever before. However, all their small but costly achievements were nullified by the defeat of the Russian People's Tsardom in the Second West Russian War. The Germans continue to mock our spirit, and it is terrifying to imagine what will happen next time—if there even is one."

 TaS_Post2WRW_SIB_japanese_paranoia_desc:0 "During the Second World War, when the USSR was barely standing, Japan invaded and captured our city of Vladivostok. They equipped the remnants of the White Movement and Russian fascists to establish their puppet regime across the entire Far East. The traitors from the RFP were punished, but the Manchurian government continued to influence Russian destinies, imposing its sick regime in Primorye and displacing the local population further north. Heroic partisans who resisted the Japanese occupation achieved notable successes.\n\nAfter unification, the Russian People's Tsardom managed to ignite the flames of rebellion and reclaim what rightfully belongs to us. However, history repeats itself. When Russia's western borders faltered, the unholy Asian claws again snatched Primorye and took Tyva. Russia remains weak, and it is difficult to predict how far Japan will advance its interests this time."

Since then, the lights of Marxism have gradually dimmed over the fragments of the former USSR, followed by the most horrific revision imaginable. The Mladorossy united the entire country under their slogan 'Tsar and Soviets.' Even a child could see how this was a mockery of the dream of a workers' dictatorship, but the people decided otherwise. Most socialists defected to the Mladorossy, and since then, the flame of revolution has been extinguished in Russia. Until recently... The Mladorossy failed Russia, and now many are turning back to communism. Following the teachings of Lenin and Sablin, we lit the fire of rebellion in Buryatia, and now all the oppressed see hope in the revolutionary flames burning beyond Lake Baikal."

It is hard to say how a small Polish state emerged in the Kazakh steppes, though there is a rational explanation involving the occupation of Poland by the Germans, the large Polish population in the USSR, and Polish generals who fought for the Revolutionary Front before its collapse. Regardless, this state became the final refuge for most Poles in Eastern Europe. Then came the Tsar-General, offering them the chance they had long awaited—to reclaim their true home. Polish commanders and soldiers once again joined the Russians in the war against the German hydra...\n\n...and were defeated again. Poland is once more in peril."

Managing such vast territories required a high degree of organization and administrative competence, which Beyrle and his team lacked. His entire makeshift government—military command and Young Russian bureaucrats who betrayed Kazem-Bek—remains critically understaffed to govern such lands.\n\nAs a result, Beyrle's enemies continue to exploit this weakness, leaving the Regency in a catastrophic state of limbo."

Every day, ships under the flags of the USA, Canada, Australia, and other free nations of the Pacific arrive at the ports of Kamchatka and Magadan. Although Zhirinovsky's regime is currently the only one in Russia recognized by the OSN and the USA, he knows the USA has its own goals in the region, and he is merely a bargaining chip in the confrontation with the Sphere.

The Urals are a natural barrier that must be crossed to open the path to Western Russia, Siberia, or Kazakhstan. Additionally, this region contains several strategically vital cities and industrial centers. Considering that during the Second West Russian War, much of Western industry was evacuated here to protect against German bombings, it is even more alarming that such a crucial region lies in the hands of perhaps the maddest dictator of the Third Smuta."

The German border now presses close to Kazan, while Bashkortostan remains under Vyatka's control. Nevertheless, the Germans are employing a more lenient approach in handling the Russian bear.

A massive influx of refugees from the Urals and the defection of some troops to Tyumen gave him some strength to fight the deranged generals.

Kazakhstan's oil rigs fueled all of Western Russia, and resource trains raced across the Urals and Siberia to fill the plants to capacity. Now, all these riches are back in the hands of the people.

 MAR_Collapse.1.d:0 "For the past few days, no one has seen Sergei Sergeyevich. He locked himself in his office, periodically requesting more bottles of Vyatka vodka from the reserves. However, he hasn't asked for any in the last 12 hours. The guards dared not enter, knowing full well that in such a mood, the Tsar might order anyone shot without reason. The defeat in the war deeply affected Belozersky's mental state, as it would anyone in Russia. Dreams of righteous vengeance and a long, happy life shattered like the half-empty shot glass slipping from the Tsar's weakened hand. The sound of breaking glass was likely the last thing Sergei Belozersky heard before losing consciousness.\n\nFourteen hours later, the guards mustered the courage to enter. The sight before them was pitiful: the room was littered with bottles of varying fullness, especially clustered around the desk. Among the glassware lay the Tsar. Sensing trouble, the soldiers asked a few questions and, receiving no answer, checked for a pulse. There was none. A hastily summoned doctor confirmed after a brief examination:"

Loudest of all screamed, or rather screeched, Antipin: 'Repent! Repent before it's too late! You are all doomed! Do you hear? Doomed!'\n\nWhen a minister not yet lost to despair tried to stop the hysterical priest, the latter swung a large cross from his chest, striking the minister's forehead. The minister, unprepared for such an assault, immediately fainted.\n\nKazem-Bek, deciding this madness must end, thought to fire a warning shot into the ceiling with his sidearm—but realized it was no longer on the desk where he left it.\n\nSurveying the chaos, he noticed the only person who had remained quiet and uninvolved. Smiling faintly in the corner, he was disengaging the safety of Kazem-Bek's own pistol. Kazem-Bek tried to stop him but was too late. A mixture of blood and brains splattered the wall. \n\nAt the sound of the gunshot the guards came and stopped the brawl, and Kazem-Bek, who had returned to his office, started thinking about what to do next."

The mistress herself darted around the mansion, checking every detail. Three hours remained until departure. Perhaps by controlling every minor aspect, Maria tried to distract herself from frightening thoughts about her future fate. How drastically war can change lives—especially defeat. Not long ago, it seemed the comfortable life of Vyatka aristocracy would last forever, but now they had to flee to another continent, hoping to survive.\n\nThe rotors of the helicopter grew louder.

Yesterday’s finest pastry shop lay in ruins; a BMP armored vehicle now crushed a morning-fresh cake into sidewalk slush.\n\nSuddenly, loudspeakers blared. The voice was familiar to all:\n\n'Attention! Cease futile resistance! We are the lawful authority and guarantors of national security! All who surrender voluntarily will be spared!' — Alexander Kazem-Bek’s speech boomed.\n\nOlga knew this message by heart. Two days had passed since troops entered the capital, yet it felt like a year.\n\nFifteen minutes later, when the tank noise faded, she ventured out. Seeing her life’s work—inherited from her father, who gave everything for this shop—destroyed, Olga collapsed to her knees, pale and sobbing."

But luckier looters found rivals waiting at the doors.\n\nTwenty minutes later, the scene devolved into a brawl.\n\nRetired police captain Pronin, who dedicated his life to order, wouldn’t let this stand. Grabbing his service revolver, he headed to the parking lot. Finding a battered truck, he smashed a window with a brick, hotwired it, and aimed at the town square.\n\nStopping 500 meters short, Pronin placed a brick on the gas pedal. Eight tons of steel plowed through the crowd, rammed the station door, and blocked the entrance. Approaching the stunned mob, Pronin lit a cigarette and cocked his pistol. The cigarette glowed. The safety clicked."

 MAR_Collapse.6.d:0 "An MGB vehicle stopped at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building. An officer entered to find a disturbing scene: crossed-out maps hung on the walls, stacks of documents littered the reception desks, and someone was hysterically arguing in the adjacent office. Several ministry employees fled at the sight of the uniformed officer, but he focused on more pressing matters.\n\nHe cautiously opened the minister's office door. A young man sat at the desk, feverishly redrawing Russia's borders on a map with a pencil.\n- 'Where is Demichev?' the officer demanded sharply.\n- 'Demichev is gone... Yesterday we received several telegrams. Our African and Middle Eastern allies—those we spilled blood for—have renounced us. Our mandate in Turkestan is sending open threats. Add to that the Tsar's death and a third consecutive defeat by Germany. Pyotr couldn't bear it.' The young man's voice trembled as he gestured to an empty vial on the desk.\n- 'What about the OFN cooperation treaty? I need it immediately!'\n- 'That's even worse than Demichev's death. The entire document package disappeared right after the Tsar's death. I suspect who took it, but the bastard has already handed them to the Abwehr or Kempeitai. The State Department will refuse to work with us when they learn of this.'\n- 'Why in hell didn't you contact us immediately?!'\n- 'We tried! Pyotr personally called yesterday, but your MGB boys were too busy...'\n\nThe officer slumped into a chair, his gaze falling on the map. Fresh pencil lines redrew Russia's western border at Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan, while the entire Far East beyond Blagoveshchensk was marked with a thick question mark."

'Soon we'll show these parasites from Vyatka what a real army looks like! I've negotiated with the retreating Caucasus group—in exchange for helping them evacuate through the Caspian, they've agreed to join our operation to save the Motherland!'\n\nApproving shouts echoed as an adjutant rushed forward:\n\n'Governor-General! First regiments of local recruits are ready. Officers have established rapport with them. All our garrisons remain in excellent condition, and since they didn't participate in the European campaign, we hold significant advantages over Regency Council forces.'\n- 'Don't celebrate yet, Lieutenant. Our operation must be swift and precise. We can't risk our garrisons fighting their former comrades.'\n\nDistant explosions interrupted them. A grizzled colonel nodded grimly:\n\n'We have days to prepare. The Motherland will be avenged, traitors harshly punished. Our soldiers' sacrifices won't be in vain.'"

I won't surrender it to the Germans,' Jaruzelski rasped, massaging his temples.\n- 'Same here! I've sent three garrisons to maintain order, but the Regency Council keeps demanding more! Are they insane? The mayor of Almaty just asked for expanded autonomy—what should I tell him?'\n- 'Focus on the capital's streets first. The situation could spiral any day.'\n- 'Do we even need to maintain ties with Vyatka? After their string of failures...'\n\nAn adjutant burst in, pale-faced: 'Your Excellency! Attacks from Turkmenistan! Enemy forces have reached Kyzylorda and are advancing through Almaty!'\n- 'That's impossible! Must be a mistake—contact Rutskoy immediately!'\n- 'No, Vitaly.

A massive portrait of Sergei Belozersky stared down judgmentally.\n\nFour of ten council ministers lay captured; six remained unaccounted for. A chained official spat:\n- 'You'll regret this, usurper! The people—'\n- 'The Regency Council is dissolved!'

Soldiers were hauling one of Zhirinovsky’s favorite trophies onto the plane—a German military jeep, captured from officers of the German expeditionary corps.\n\nHowever, his task was interrupted by a motorcade speeding down the runway, alarming everyone and causing the soldiers to keep their fingers on their triggers. When the motorcade approached close enough, Saddam Hussein emerged with his bodyguards. Zhirinovsky walked toward him to find out what was happening.\n\n- Vladimir, what the hell! Where are you going? - Saddam began in broken Russian, not hiding his displeasure.\n- First of all, hello. Second, you should know that Russia is going through tough times now. - Zhirinovsky replied, showing no concern.\n- But you can’t just fly away! Iraq will be torn apart if you leave us. - Hussein objected.\n- Saddam, I know your people, I know you. Baghdad will become a graveyard for your enemies.\nThe Iraqi ruler was stunned by such a confident and insane statement but couldn’t find words.\n- But how... - he began, but was interrupted by a soldier: \"The plane is loaded, Vladimir Volfovich, we’re ready to depart.\"\n- No time for goodbyes.

Calls to Vyatka yielded nothing but promises to send reinforcements \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nIn the evening, the only military commander holding back the enemy’s advance, with whom the governor had been working, stopped responding. By noon, it became clear that Mengjiang forces, reinforced by Japanese units, were entering the city, where they were met by hastily assembled militia and retreating troops of the People's Tsardom. Helicopters of the Sphere circled above the city, artillery thunderously destroyed residential buildings where soldiers held their defense, and distant smoke constantly reminded him that delay was fatal.\n\nThe governor was completely crushed and didn’t know what to do, futilely dialing his phone until he heard the roar of a helicopter flying over the administration. He understood this boded no good. Alexey tried to compose himself until a squad of armed Japanese burst into his office.\n\"Surrender, Russian. Tuva will be part of the Sphere. Surrender, or we’ll kill you,\" said the Japanese officer in broken Russian.\nThe governor, immediately realizing what to do, said:\n\"Alright, you’ll have Tuva.\"\nThe Japanese officer, visibly pleased, was about to place the surrender documents on the governor’s desk.\n\nAt that moment, Alexey jumped up, drew his TT pistol, and shot two Japanese.

To their surprise, people joyfully greeted them, handing flowers and shouting \"Welcome!\" Even Magadan’s police units guarding the port were glad to see the return of the Iraqi peacekeeping contingent to Russia.\n\nFrom conversations, it became clear that the regional capital, recently moved to Vladivostok, had been reoccupied by the Japanese, who took advantage of the chaos to annex Primorye again, seizing Blagoveshchensk, which had been gifted to Rodzaevsky. The return of Russia’s finest sons greatly inspired the people.\n\nThat evening, the mayor of Magadan hosted the legendary \"Jackal of Iraq.\" Zhirinovsky, tired after the long journey, was glad to rest and discuss what had happened in his absence.\n\n- Saddam Hussein didn’t give me a single dinar. If he had, I would’ve taken it. - He recounted.\n- Vladimir Volfovich, how are you after the journey? It was a long trip. - Asked the mayor.\n- I’m excellent. Now my boys and I are finally home... Baghdad, then Brisbane. Am I right that the Americans warned you in advance?\n- Yes, we both know the Japanese wouldn’t stop at Primorye this time, so the CIA urgently sought a strong Russian man, someone who could make the Japanese abandon their plans for the Far East.\n- And here I am, how conveniently it all worked out. - Vladimir smirked.\n\nThe evening passed with a bottle of strong homemade vodka as the two men discussed their fears and risks but equally understood that for the first time in many years, Magadan had a Leader again—Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky."

 MAR_Collapse.14.d:0 "Some time had passed since Zhirinovsky arrived in Magadan. Gazing from his office at the streets of his new capital of the Far Eastern People's Republic, Vladimir Volfovich sighed pensively. Yesterday, his country had urgently been granted OSC observer status. This meant the eastern threat would retreat—at least for now. However, if the enemy was brazen enough to attack a second time, what would change on the third? Vladimir returned to his desk, where stacks of papers awaited him. Very promising papers. Lists of volunteers from all corners of the world, arms shipments from OSC stockpiles, credit agreements with America, recruitment campaigns in Chita and Amur. Yet, despite this, the general felt a certain melancholy. People would surely call this the Third Smuta, but if he acted quickly, there was still a chance to avoid major bloodshed. Otherwise, Russia faced catastrophe. The final catastrophe.\n\nThe Jackal of Iraq unfolded a redrawn map of Russia on his desk: he needed to decide which of the Motherland’s traitors would be first to the gallows. To the west, Joseph Beyrle had carved out all of Siberia for himself, where he retreated with his army after defeat in the Moscow campaign. Joe would definitely be a problem, but reaching him required dealing with one of these two first—the Republic of Sakha or the Republic of Buryatia. While Zhirinovsky tried to decide who would be the first victim of his ambitions, the phone rang.\n\n- Hello, Vladimir Volfovich? This is the Foreign Ministry. You’re urgently needed from Buryatia.\n- Connect me. - Vladimir said confidently.\n- Good day. This is the General Secretary of the Republic of Buryatia. May I assume I’m speaking with Mr. Zhirinovsky? - A woman’s voice said.\n- Yes, it’s me. What would you like to discuss? - Zhirinovsky responded, tapping the map where Lake Baikal was highlighted.\n- I am Susanna Pechuro Solomonovna. We would like to sign a non-aggression pact with your country. - The voice insisted confidently.\n- As you know, everything has its price, Susanna. What can Buryatia offer us in return? - Zhirinovsky set his terms, contemplating how to color Buryatia on his map."

Both men were deputies in the Tomsk City Duma, from the Bastilyar salon. However, today they were arrested and shoved into a truck during a work meeting.\n\nThe truck drove along a smooth road, then a dirt road, and finally off-road. They stopped.

Where are we? Why were we brought here?\n- I ask the questions here, - said a man with an American accent. When did you last contact Kazem-Bek? - His voice sounded oddly familiar.\n- Kazem-Bek... He called us almost immediately after the war.

Or maybe the Tsar just died? He wasn’t young, after all...\n- I’ve heard that voice somewhere... - Ruslan whispered, guessing who stood before them.\n- You have ten seconds to tell me how involved you are in the conspiracy against the Tsar.

But the tactical retreat only masked open rebellion against Vyatka. Nothing and no one could stop the mad general’s insane idea—building a Russian National Republic in the Ural Mountains. The industrial centers of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust were rebuilt in the image of Muscovy and worked to exhaustion. Non-Russian populations were forcibly deported to Vorkuta camps, which, unfortunately, reopened their doors to all undesirables. All this was tied to Gil’s insane militarism. Thus, it was only a matter of time before the new regime orchestrated another massacre on Russian soil. Reaching Vyatka required crossing the Urals again, and holding Kazakh lands would be too difficult. The Regency of Joe Beyrle could fight back, so Gil’s gaze fell on the Tyumen Republic—a newborn democratic refuge under President Primakov’s control.

And Kosygin, instead of showing himself as a leader, which he should be, and addressing the people, refuting all speculations and preventing even the thought of revolution, is simply hiding in his residence! In his office!

Maybe we can manage on our own? – Gil said.\n\nSuddenly, from an assistant who approached the tsar, came the information that the emperor’s representative was about to enter the hall.\n\n- Thank you.

Their pretext is simple: the self-determination of Central Asian peoples in accordance with the Japanese doctrine of the co-prosperity of the eight corners of the world.\n\nAfter such a fatal proposal, the tsar put forward a counterproposal to take a break. The Japanese side supported the proposal for a break, and while the Japanese delegation rested with a royal flush in hand: in fact, their \"peacekeeping\" troops occupied Russia, and its government became too dependent on the Empire of the Rising Sun politically and economically.

And what only prompted him to go on this idiotic adventure with the tsarist title? If he hadn’t done it, Alexander Lvovich would be alive. However, Kosygin knew the answer to this question perfectly well.\n\nHe finally managed to force himself out of this state of trance and approach the window, open it wide, and look at the streets of Vyatka. He dreamed of making people happy, giving them power over their own destinies. He dreamed that every person would be a tsar. In the end, it turned out quite the opposite. Not a single person in Russia truly became a tsar.\n\nSeeing the Japanese patrol, the tsar began to boil with anger again, but, as it turned out, there was no strength left to be angry. Relaxing, the tsar became even gloomier.\n\n- What a shame... – He said quietly.\n\nMoving away from the window, the tsar prepared to take another dose of sedative. But just as he was about to exhale, he heard the door to his office opening.\n\n- Your High Excellency. Allow me to address you. – The entering secretary said.\n\n- What do you have? – The tsar asked laconically.\n\n- The Japanese government has sent us a proposal to join the Sphere of Co-Prosperity.

What a nightmare. How did we lose everything so quickly? – Ivan wondered, just like many other people in his native Perm, and indeed throughout the country.\n\nContinuing his way to work, Ivan tried to find answers to the questions but clearly did not succeed in this. At that moment, he remembered that not long ago, his old boss had promised him a promotion. But now, to be promoted, you must know Japanese, and without it, you will remain not in the middle but in the lower class of society.\n\nSighing and looking at his watch, Ivan found that there was still time before work started.

Several minutes of silence preceded the moment when Gil took out a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe his face – sweat was streaming down it. A deep cough betrayed tension.\n\nWhen the long-awaited: \"Get ready... Action!\" sounded, the microphones and cameras came to life. The time had come:\n\n–Dear subjects of the Russian Empire... Today I am forced to convey to you unpleasant news and the bitter truth. Alexei Kosygin, who called himself Alexei II, turned out to be a false tsar – an impostor who hid his origin and the absence of Romanov blood behind the mask of a ruler. His ambitions and mistakes led to catastrophic consequences: our state plunged into the chaos of destructive conflicts, leaving us ruined and disgraced. The realization of Alexei Kosygin’s true nature caused popular indignation. Unrest swept the country – protests against the crowned deception became inevitable. In the conditions of the crisis, when the state was on the verge of collapse, the government was forced to act decisively: the false Alexei abdicated the throne and was expelled from power, and to overcome the reigning chaos, a difficult decision was made to introduce a state of emergency. Be faithful to the Motherland! In these unbearable times, when radicals are rushing to destroy our common home, stand as a united front against the dark forces. Do not let manipulations and false ideas take over your hearts. Cooperate with the KGB representatives – only together can we overcome the storms! Remember that the future of Russia depends on each of us.\n\nGil’s speech ended under the pressure of circumstances; his voice trembled before numerous pauses, like an echo of impending disaster.

Any word could be the last – sounds and glances became suspicious signs in this atmosphere of universal fear.\n\nCities that recently bustled with life now froze like corpses; streets plunged into the darkness of silence – no loud conversations, no laughter, only short and wary glances slid along the dark alleys. The curfew became an immutable law of life. Steps were tracked to the last sound, car numbers were entered into endless lists as symbols of suspicion and control. All this was declared an inevitable means for \"preserving\" the state.\n\nFear deeply ingrained in people’s souls, and hatred corroded them from within, like poison, slowly poisoning consciousness.

 TaS_RUSEpilogue_news.16.d: "The Russo-Japanese agreement continues accumulating additional conditions: Tokyo increasingly insists on new demands, leading to Russia's de facto abandonment of control over multiple Central Asian territories – regions previously reclaimed during reunification. These lands are no longer considered subjects of claims or interest by the imperial government.\n\nThough Japanese official statements emphasize supporting these territories' right to self-determination, analysts leave no doubt that the 'liberated' states will fall under strong influence from global powers. Their sovereignty will be severely constrained by external forces demonstrating vested interests in these regions.\n\nTrapped in a precarious position, Russia proves incapable of countering this process, reduced to passively observing these transformations without means for meaningful intervention."

 TaS_RUSEpilogue_news.17.d: "The signed document culminated imperial collaboration: Russia entered Japan's patronage through accession to the Co-Prosperity Sphere, integrating into its economic zone. Having lost autonomy, Russia was compelled to accept this arrangement, sparking widespread recognition of sovereignty's erosion among both external observers and its own populace.\n\nDespite Alexei II's lofty rhetoric about economic revival, all understood the tragedy: Russia had become a pawn in Japanese geopolitics. Japanese capital rapidly seized Russian markets, displacing domestic enterprises and industries. Furthermore, mandatory Japanese language education is being imposed nationwide, disregarding public ignorance or resistance.\n\nThus concluded Russia's historical chapter as an independent power: its sovereignty yielded to foreign interests, national identity dissolving into a new imperial reality."

 TaS_RUSEpilogue_news.18.d: "Russia is shaken once more by unforeseen events: Alexei II (formerly Alexei Kosygin), once exalted as the 'People's Tsar' but now tainted by reputation as an arch-deceiver, has performed a staggering act - abdicated the throne. In this dramatic situation, Vladimir Gill's government attempted to justify the failures of Alexei II's reign by shifting full responsibility onto the monarch.\n\nThat same day, citing the monarch's overthrow, a State of Emergency was declared. KGB forces mobilized as order-restoration measure. Russia's future becomes shrouded in uncertainty while domestic tensions escalate from profound internal divisions."

 TaS_RUSEpilogue_news.19.d: "The Russian Empire's collapse became inevitable. The KGB's stability measures backfired catastrophically, igniting mass protests and revolts. The repressive apparatus' brutality fueled swelling discontent across social strata. This culminated in nationwide uprisings that fractured the country into sovereign entities.\n\nVladimir Gill's regime desperately tried consolidating resources in surviving regions, retaining only fragments of former territory. Where the Russian People's Empire once stood emerged weakened statelets plunged into internal crises - economic collapse and social strife. Thus the empire's disintegration marked not just political downfall, but the dawn of a chaotic era brimming with instability."

Rapid territorial seizures were consolidated through appointed governors who immediately imposed new legal systems and order. The region fell under foreign metropolitan rule, sparking mixed reactions among locals – from hopes for stability to vehement rejection of occupation."
