 despotism_mladorossi_autocracy_subtype_desc:0 "The ideology of the Mladorossi underwent unusual metamorphoses in the conditions of Russian anarchy. Constant instability, numerous threats, and a multitude of extremists led to the emergence of the so-called Mladorossi Autocracy. \n\nThe system formulated by Tsar Sergei Belozersky significantly changed the initial ideology. Much more power is now concentrated in the hands of the tsar, and the prime minister is only an advisor, not an indisputable truth. Only the words of the tsar are considered as the truth. \n\nAnother integral part of the ideology is a much greater emphasis on militarization and the army. Perhaps these metamorphoses went against the founder's opinion of the ideology. However, now it does not make much of a difference. "Tsar and councils!" This is the slogan that will sound in the new, strong, and honest Russian Empire, and no one can stop it."

 paternalism_mladorossi_idea_subtype_desc:0 "Mladorossism is a very unusual ideology. In the first half of the twentieth century, Alexander Kazem-Bek created his syncretic ideology. The new political system was truly something unusual, as it combined the ideas of fascism and communism.\n\nIn the end, a method of governing the state was created with an order-type party, the purpose of which is enlightenment and a tsar at the head who is not a representative of any party. Also, the basis of the system are non-party councils, which are a way of interacting with local and central government offices of the monarch.\n\nAfter all, the Mladorossi movement is an unusual ideology. Cult of personality and monarchy here are opposed to totalitarianism. And the idea of spiritual brotherhood and strict national discipline ensure the creative freedom of the individual. And even though the movement is heterogeneous and many representatives of the Mladorossi have their own ideas on how to transform the ideology, the slogan \"Tsar and  Soviets\" remains unchanged."

 fascism_mladosocialism_subtype_desc:0 "The monarchist bias of the Mladorossi, according to the Mladosocialists led by Vladimir Gil, are outdated and can give nothing but the troubles and sufferings of Russia. Mladorossi were not able to create the people's tsardom, about which they cherished their dreams so much, and they were defeated by the hands of Tsar Vladimir III. However, they all showed their inability and showed complete detachment from reality. There is nothing to say that monarchism is not outdated and even useful.\n\nAt the same time, Bukharin's socialism turned out to be even more harmful to Russia, and because of his softness towards national minorities and weak control over the regions, the USSR did not achieve any success in the economy and in creating the country's defense capability, which led to sad consequences in the face of a fragmented Russia with more than 50 parts. Socialism in its pure form is harmful, but its individual ideas will be useful for Russia.\n\nVladimir Gil is convinced that only the third way for Russia will be right for development, since the Motherland simply has no other options. Combining the fascist base and some details of socialist ideals, Gil created a new ideology: Mladosocialism, which completely abandons monarchism in favor of fascist and social development of Russia. Only a firm hand with maximum well-being for the united Russian people will allow them to withstand new challenges that may fall on Russia in the near future."
 socialist_social_monarchist_subtype:0 "Social Monarchism"
 socialist_social_monarchist_subtype_desc:0 "The Mladorossi ideology itself has a lot in common with the Soviet principles of governing the country, as the ideology aims to create a people's kingdom with a fair, truly popular monarch. However, there are frequent cases when socialist ideas are strengthened, which ultimately leads us to the creation of a left-wing socialist-monarchist trend. Based on planned economy, people's councils, and strong ideology, as was the case in Bukharin's USSR, they try to create a monarchic type of government that is based solely on the people, as the Soviet leadership did in old times. \n\nTsar Alexei II was elected by the people, and he, as an original socialist, proposed his concept of Mladorossism, which falls under the concept of “social monarchism”. His concept is quite unique, unlike the orthodox ideas of Alexander Kazem-Bek, so the socialist-monarchist ideology with a leftward bias can live distinctively."
 socialist_social_monarchist_but_worse_subtype:0 "Social Monarchism"
 socialist_social_monarchist_but_worse_subtype_desc:0 "History knows many unusual ideological symbioses, but perhaps the most interesting of them is monarchic socialism. Based on the ideology of the king and councils, it is one of the most unusual creations of Russian anarchy. Here, market methods are mixed with Soviet aesthetics and the aspiration for a bright future in which everyone will be equal. And while the monarch sits in his palace, hundreds of councils are involved in governing the country. \n\nOf course, many socialist regimes call monarchic socialism a crude restoration of monarchy, another offspring of reaction, and even a way to discredit the left movement. But as long as the people stand behind the king, and the nation moves forward united by a single impulse, there is no sense in paying attention to the words of the envious. Perhaps this is not what the classics of communism wrote about, but there is no limit to experiments. For the king and the councils!"

 despotism_securitocracy_subtype_desc:0 "Like any state, the Soviet Union had its own secret service, which was engaged in the search for dissenters - the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD.\n\nHowever, when the Soviet Union, and after it, the Western Russian Revolutionary Front fell, the NKVD detachment at the Vokrutinsky Correctional Labor Camp, under the leadership of Vasily Blokhin, established its own state on the territory of Vokruta. Together with the state, a unique ideology appeared for it - securitocracy.\n\nThe main principles of this ideology are strict maintenance of internal security thanks to local NKVD squads. The slightest violation of existing legislation entails either execution or sending to a correctional labor camp. Moreover, both ordinary citizens of Vokruta and NKVD officers who violated the law, according to the government's opinion, fall under the repression.\n\nDetractors, represented by anti-communist and other press, call the regime in Vorkuta police, an analogue of military dictatorship. At the same time, they ask one big question to the regime in Vorkuta: can a regime that exists in Vorkuta function throughout the entire country? Can a dictatorship of law, which is built on repression of its own population against its own population under the guise of legality and Marxist-Leninist teachings, last long? After all, a regime that is built on the blood of its citizens will sooner or later end in a bloody revolution."
