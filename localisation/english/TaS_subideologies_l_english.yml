 despotism_mladorossi_autocracy_subtype_desc:0 "The Mladorossi ideology has undergone unusual metamorphoses under Russian anarchy. Constant instability, numerous threats, and multiple extremists have led to the emergence of the so-called Mladorossi Autocracy.\n\nThe system formulated by Tsar Sergei Belozersky has significantly altered the original ideology. Far more power is now concentrated directly in the hands of the Tsar, with the Prime Minister serving merely as an advisor, and the Tsar's own words being the indisputable truth.\n\nAn integral part of this ideology is a much greater emphasis on militarization and the army. These transformations might have contradicted the views of the ideology's founder. However, this now makes little difference. 'Tsar and Soviets!' - this slogan will resonate throughout the new, strong, and honest Russian Empire, and no one will be able to hinder it."

 paternalism_mladorossi_idea_subtype_desc:0 "Mladorossism is a highly unusual ideology. In the first half of the twentieth century, Alexander Kazem-Bek created his syncretic ideology. The new political system was truly something unique, combining elements of fascism and communism.\n\nUltimately, a state management method was developed with an order-type party aimed at enlightenment, and a Tsar at the head who does not belong to any party. The foundation of the system also consists of non-party Soviets that serve as a means of interaction between local and central representations of the monarch's power.\n\nIn the end, the Mladorossi movement represents an extraordinary ideology. Leader-worship and monarchy here stand opposed to totalitarianism. The idea of spiritual brotherhood and strict national discipline ensure creative freedom for the individual. Though the movement is heterogeneous and many Mladorossi adherents have their own ideas about transforming the ideology, the slogan 'Tsar and Soviets' remains immutable."
 socialist_social_monarchist_subtype:0 "Social-Monarchism"
 socialist_social_monarchist_subtype_desc:0 "The Mladorossi ideology itself shares many similarities with Soviet principles of governance, aiming to create a people's kingdom with a just, truly popular Tsar. However, there are frequent cases where socialist ideas are strengthened, ultimately leading to the creation of a left-leaning variant of social-monarchism. Relying on planned economy, people's councils, and strong ideology – as in Bukharin's USSR – they attempt to build upon this foundation a monarchical form of government that relies exclusively on the people, much like the Soviet leadership of old.\n\nTsar Alexei II was elected by the people, and as an original socialist, he proposed his own concept of Mladorossism that falls under 'social-monarchism'. His concept is highly distinctive compared to the orthodox ideas of Alexander Kazem-Bek, allowing left-leaning social-monarchism to exist as a unique ideology."

 socialist_social_monarchist_but_worse_subtype_desc:0 "History knows many unusual ideological symbioses, but perhaps the most interesting is monarcho-socialism. Based on the ideology of the Tsar and Soviets, it stands as one of the most peculiar products of Russian anarchy. Here market methods blend with Soviet aesthetics and aspirations for a bright future where all will be equal. While the monarch resides in their palace, hundreds of councils participate in governing the country.\n\nOf course, many socialist regimes label monarcho-socialism as crude monarchical restoration, another product of reactionary forces, even a way to discredit the leftist movement. But while the people stand behind the Tsar and the nation moves forward united by a single purposeful impulse, there's no need to heed the words of envious critics. This may not be what the communist classics wrote about, but experiments know no bounds. For the Tsar and Soviets!"

 despotism_securitocracy_subtype_desc:0 "Like any state, the Soviet Union had its own secret service, which was engaged in the search for dissenters - the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD.\n\nHowever, when the Soviet Union, and after it, the Western Russian Revolutionary Front fell, the NKVD detachment at the Vokrutinsky Correctional Labor Camp, under the leadership of Vasily Blokhin, established its own state on the territory of Vokruta. Together with the state, a unique ideology appeared for it - securitocracy.\n\nThe main principles of this ideology are strict maintenance of internal security thanks to local NKVD squads. The slightest violation of existing legislation entails either execution or sending to a correctional labor camp. Moreover, both ordinary citizens of Vokruta and NKVD officers who violated the law, according to the government's opinion, fall under the repression.\n\nDetractors, represented by anti-communist and other press, call the regime in Vorkuta police, an analogue of military dictatorship. At the same time, they ask one big question to the regime in Vorkuta: can a regime that exists in Vorkuta function throughout the entire country? Can a dictatorship of law, which is built on repression of its own population against its own population under the guise of legality and Marxist-Leninist teachings, last long? After all, a regime that is built on the blood of its citizens will sooner or later end in a bloody revolution."
