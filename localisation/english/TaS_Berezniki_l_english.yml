 MAR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Being just an eastern province of Tsar Vladimir III's Vyatka, Berezniki, led by its governor Aleksandr Kazem-Bek, is a highly distinctive region not only within the Western territory, but perhaps within the entirety of the free Russia. Seeking to unite the best of both the Tsarist and Soviet regimes, Kazem-Bek's ideology has developed the Mladorossian idea, which harmoniously combines both regimes. Many have heard of "Mladorossism", but all are inclined to think that Berezniki is the dark horse of free Russia with its insane ideas of crossing two incompatible ideologies.\n\nKazem-Bek and his people are subservient to Vladimir III, and even though they find some common ground on certain issues, it is evident that such a status quo will not be upheld. Aleksandr has his own vision for the future of Russia, which runs counter to that of Tsar Vladimir. Perhaps it is worth reconsidering one's view of their hidden potential?"

 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.1: "The Movement's History"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "It would take more than a thousand words to describe the pain that §WRussia§! went through since the day Emperor Nicholas abdicated. It seemed that in a moment, the entire country went crazy. Hunger, terror, wars. It is not surprising that among people who remembered peaceful times before the abdication, monarchist ideas found a response. Among Russian White emigrants, an infinite number of monarchist parties were formed. Without a doubt, the most extravagant emigrant party was §Rthe Mladorossi Party§! of §YAlexander Kazem-Bek§!.\n\n§RThe Mladorossi Party§! ceased to exist in 1942. After the end of his party activities, §YAlexander Kazem-Bek§! participated in countless diverse organizations. But in the moment of the greatest national grief, his soul inevitably strove for §Wthe Homeland§!."
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.2: "Kazem-Bek's History"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "§RThe West Russian War§! - a desperate attempt by the Communists to take revenge, ended in a catastrophe. The collapse of §Rthe West Russian Revolutionary Front§! led to the appearance of an innumerable multitude of cliques, hordes, and directorates. One of such political formations was §Gthe Vyatka Principality§!. §WVladimir Romanov§!, who led this country, could not single-handedly control his entire estate, so he separated the §YZakamsk Governorate§! from §GVyatka§!. §YAlexander Kazem-Bek§!, partly thanks to his intelligence and because of his authority in the emigration environment, sometimes thanks to luck, and often due to his ties with §BCIA§!, in 1958, he was able to take control of the governorate virtually. Since then, he has methodically cleared Vladimir's loyalists in the governorate, while developing seemingly forgotten ideas of §Rthe Mladorossi§!."
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.3: "Relations with Vyatka"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "De jure, §YBerezniki§! are still subject to §GVyatka§!, but almost all of §WVladimir's§! influence in this territory has been reduced to zero. It would be foolish to think that §WVladimir§! is an idiot and is unaware of what is happening in the distant governorate. However, the king is currently busy with his affairs in his own realm. Although §GVyatka§! is attempting to interfere in the politics of the governorate, the king's agents rarely act on their own initiative, causing only the Bereznikovsky counterintelligence to become nervous. Therefore, §RKazem-Bek§! can sleep peacefully for now, knowing that the §nOkhranka§! agents will not come for him anytime soon.\n\nOnly God knows when a black cat will run across the path of the king and the wayward governor's relationship. Nevertheless, almost no one doubts that sooner or later this will happen, and then the lives of both, as well as hundreds of their subordinates, will be at stake."

 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.4: "The story of Gil"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "§rVladimir Gil§! is one of the few leading figures of §YBerezniki§! who fought in both wars with the Germans in the trenches. However, it is difficult to describe §rGil's§! combat path as heroic or valiant. In the first month of the war, he was captured. In the autumn of 1941, he began his slippery slope of cooperation with the Germans. In 1942, §rGil§! led the punitive squad "Druzhina", which soon grew into a brigade. The brigade carried out punitive actions against partisan groups in the territory of Vitebsk region.\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade made the partisans all over Belarus fear §rGil§!. This same effectiveness allowed §rGil§! to remain in the ranks of the §bSS§! after the end of Operation Barbarossa.\n\nAmid the chaos of the §RWest Russian War§! and the army rebellion that followed within the §bSS§!, §rGil§! switched sides to the §RWRRF§!. When §GOperation Suvorov§! failed, §rGil§! and a small group of officers of the §RWRRF§! managed to take refuge in the §YZakamsk governorate§!, where he welcomed the year 1962." 
 
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.5: "The story of Belozersky"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "§C Sergey Beloselsky-Belozersky§!, often simply called §C Belozersky§!, was one of the White emigrants who returned to Vyatka after the appeal of §W Vladimir III§!. Before the end of the §R West Russian War§!, §C Belozersky§! also served in France, Britain, and even in the American §B OSS and CIA.§! It was there that Belozersky met and befriended Alexander Kazem-Bek. Fate bound their destinies for many years. When §C Belozersky§! was sent to France, §R Kazem-Bek§! was with him. They also joined the §W Vladimir III§! emigrant organization together. Following in the footsteps of §R Kazem-Bek§!, §C Belozersky§! went to the §Y Zakamsk Governorate§!, becoming a loyal friend, a reliable ally, and a strong support for his comrade. Whether their cooperation will continue until the end or whether the roads of §R Kazem-Bek§! and §C Belozersky§! are destined to part - only time will tell."
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.6: "The story of Kosygin"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "§eAlexei Kosygin§!, against the background of the domination of former collaborators and White emigrants, looks like a red apple among a pile of potatoes. He achieved success under the §R Soviet government§! even before the war began. And during the war, he was appointed Chairman of the Evacuation Council. Unlike many chairmen of similar committees, he was concerned not with saving his own skin, but with fulfilling the assigned task. He worked selflessly. While evacuating enterprises behind the Urals, he ironically refused to evacuate until the last moment. Only when the front approached Moscow made §eKosygin§! go to §G Rykov§!. It was the work of Kosygin that allowed §RWRRF§! to accumulate enough materiel to begin the "Suvorov" operation. Nevertheless, when the front began to crumble, many generals and commissars hastened to make him a scapegoat. Hunted from all sides, Kosygin found refuge in §YBerezniki§!."

 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KAZEMBEK_DESC:0 "Born into the family of a retired guardsman and leader of the nobility of the Spassky district of the Kazan province, Lev Alexandrovich Kazem-Bek, future leader of the Mladorossi movement, traveled extensively throughout Russia and Western Europe due to his father's official transfers. Later, he graduated from the Tsarskoe Selo Real School of Emperor Nicholas II and began participating in the scouting movement, achieving the rank of scout master in May 1917. In November 1919, in Rostov, Alexander was enlisted in the Ulan regiment of the "White" Volunteer Army, where he commanded a marching squadron consisting of only 40 people, most of whom were former Red Army prisoners. However, he soon fell ill and on January 17, 1920, he sailed with his parents on the steamer "Irtysh" to Constantinople, and then through Salonika to Belgrade.\n\nIn 1923, while living in Munich, Kazem-Bek organized the youth union "Mladorossi", from which the unique Mladorossi movement emerged in 1925, this time in Paris. Initially, Alexander Lvovich sympathized with Hitler and Mussolini and considered Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich worthy of the Russian throne, but he died and the leader of the monarchist-communists could not find common ground with Kirill's son, "emperor" Vladimir Kirillovich. However, after 1937, Kazem-Bek took a leftward turn, realizing that the policies of Germany and Italy were directed against the USSR, and these two countries would clearly not bring anything good to his homeland.\n\nWhen the war broke out, Kazem-Bek was in France and was arrested in early 1940 and held in a cell with Leon Degrelle, but was later released by the authorities and went to the United States, where after the start of the war between Germany and the USSR, he disbanded his party "to give each of its members full opportunity to fulfill their patriotic duty towards the fighting Homeland according to their own understanding". After the war, he lived and engaged in educational activities in the United States, as well as collaborated with local intelligence. With the beginning of the Western Russian War, he was invited to the "Sun" project, the aim of which was to infiltrate the ranks of Vladimir III's collaborators and remove him from power. He brought some of his former comrades with him, as well as his old acquaintance Sergei Belozersky. After arriving in Russia, using old connections and bribes, Kazem-Bek nevertheless gained Vladimir III's confidence and was appointed governor of Zakamye. Now he is waiting for the right moment to get rid of Vladimir III and create a new and renewed Russia."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_DESC:0 "Mladorossi Russia has cleansed itself from its dark past thanks to its virtues and determination to revive the nation from the ashes. We were able to do this thanks to the efforts of all those who cared about us. Among them was the current Tsar Sergey Belozersky.\n\nElected by the Zemsky Sobor, the Tsar is worthy of the nickname "General-Tsar" as he held military positions in Bereznyaky. Until recently, he held the post of Chief of the Armed Forces of Bereznyaky, and earlier served in the army of Nicholas II and the American army. He returned to his homeland to help his citizens restore their former glory, and only the Mladorossiya can restore that glory.\n\nNow that he is in power, Belozersky realizes the full extent of his responsibility. The "General-Tsar" is an experienced administrator, and he understands very well how the country should be governed. His firm grip and the passionate heart of the Mladorossiya will help in this matter. He is supported by the entire country, and he must live up to the expectations of these people. Much work remains to be done to establish order in Russia and even more to unite the entire homeland under one flag. Belozersky must not shame his ancestors, and he will succeed and surpass them." 

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_70S_DESC:0 "Tsar-General Belozersky managed to unite all free Russia under his rule. As a distant descendant of the Rurik dynasty, he was able to prove to everyone that he is the true heir of his great ancestors, and now no one will accuse him of being a liar and impostor. All enemies were overthrown and removed from power from their pseudo-states, no matter how they had established them.\n\nCombining the best of modernity and the past regime, he earned the title of a true elected Tsar of Mladarussia. The Russian people rose up and are ready to move forward again, regardless of the horrible events of the past. And yet, in some places, he still exaggerated - the power is still stronger with the Tsar, and perhaps it is for the better, because such great successes have been achieved. And perhaps the roots of strong power come from the royal Russia, which disappeared more than half a century ago.\n\nStill, Belozersky does not plan to stop there. There is nothing that could now prevent the Russian people from seeking righteous revenge for their defeat in the Great Patriotic War. The Russian people will liberate Moscow, and it is fate that has destined us for this, just as it is destined that Belozersky will emerge as the winner of the battle for all of Russia.\n\nHowever, some are concerned about his quite advanced age, which is already making itself felt. There is no time for reflection, so Russia will prepare for a sacred campaign, as did Minin and Pozharsky.\n\n§RTo Moscow§!."

The revolution destroyed these hopes, and his family had to flee first to the south to the "whites", and after their defeat, the Vilchkovskys went to France.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Kirill met the "Mladorossi" party and personally met its leader, Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek. Thanks to his charisma and hard work, he quickly became the party's secretary and the right-hand man of the leader of the monarchist-socialists.\n\nTime passed, and clouds were gathering over Europe. On September 1, 1939, thunder finally roared - World War II began. In early 1940, Elita-Vilchkovsky was arrested by the French government on suspicion of espionage, but soon after the war's defeat, he was released. Learning that Kazem-Bek had disbanded the party, he joined the "Fighting France" movement, like many former members of "Mladorossi", but due to the Reich's victory, Kirill was forced to flee with a group of American volunteers.\n\nAfter the war, the "Mladorossi" member lived in Atlanta, occasionally crossing paths with Alexander Lvovich, but the beginning of the West Russian War greatly changed his life. Kazem-Bek invited Kirill to participate in the "Sun" project - a CIA operation to infiltrate loyal US emigrants into the echelons of power of the pro-German forces of Vladimir III. Soon Vilchkovsky and his fellow party members returned to their homeland, and though the initial infiltration plan was successful, Vladimir still suspects something. Therefore, Kirill must now help his friend outsmart the Tsar and finally save Russia from Judas."

However, the start of the war found Sergey Sergeevich again in Great Britain, where he joined the Royal Air Force and, after bloody battles, was evacuated along with the remnants of the country's army to the United States. However, Belozersky did not give up there and continued to serve in the US Army, but retired in the early 1950s as a major.\n\nWith the start of the Western Russian War, the descendant of the Ruriks was recruited by the CIA as a military expert for Operation "Sun," and subsequently went to Russia with the Mladorossians, where he became the Minister of Defense under the guidance of Kazem-Bek.\n\nBelozersky, despite his past, seeks to help his homeland, but only time will tell how he will do it."

With the onset of the war, he was involved in evacuating property to Siberia.\n\nAfter the defeat in the war, he was forced to join the Western Russian Revolutionary Front, where he held various positions in the economic ministry, trying to alleviate people's lives.

With the onset of the Western Russian War, he defected to the Reds, handing over all the German officers to them, and himself became the commander of one of the divisions under Tukhachevsky's command, where he, despite his past, found a common language with him.

His loyalty to his country and desire to help it in any way possible seemed boundless. Having managed to join the front with Germany in the last weeks of the war, Anatoly didn't even fire a shot. The Red Army was retreating while he was in training.\n\nHe didn't make it. He didn't make it. It seemed that he was broken, because he couldn't save the country in a difficult moment. He didn't defend his homeland, and therefore decided to dedicate himself to military affairs. It seemed to him an act of atonement for his guilt before the tens of millions of fellow citizens who had already died, and whom he did not defend. In the new world, he was alone. But despite this, Anatoly studied military affairs in the fields of Western Russia, later applying his knowledge of strategy in the West Russian War. It was he, the young general, close to his subordinates, who led the Red Army into attack. An attack that turned out to be successful. The subsequent defeats of the Soviet Union on the front did not knock him down, although they severely undermined him. After the collapse of the country, he ended up in Berezniki. Subsequently, he bitterly participated on the fronts against his former comrades who had ended up on the other side of the barricades. For his services to Berezniki, he was made a field marshal.\n\nProving over decades that he was the son of Holy Russia, it was Anatoly Vavilov who inspired young soldiers and officers who learned his biography in the capital's military academies.

To stimulate the increase in the level of education, they will be made free, and almost everyone in our small state will be able to get at least basic knowledge. Moreover, we need to seriously reconsider our approach to higher education, which has been self-sustaining for many years.

Kazem-Bek walked up to the mirror installed in the office and looked at his reflection. He was carefully studying his reflection. He looked at the clothes of Governor Bereznikov, gazed into the eyes of Vladimir's faithful companion, and tried to look into the soul of the CIA agent nicknamed 'Spider.' But the longer he looked, the clearer the words echoed in his head: 'This is not me.' And then he realized that he did not see Alexander Kazem-Bek, the patriot of his country and Mladoross, his true essence was hidden as if a board on which each new word was written over the previous one.\n\nThe blizzard outside was becoming stronger, but the thoughts in his head became only clearer. The leader of the Mladoross party began to understand that over the years after escaping from Russia, he had practically lost his face, life was striking blow after blow, hindering the great idea of a new Russia, and it seemed that Alexander had already given up. He accepted that he was just another gear in the mechanism of history, whose fate was to disappear into oblivion or be replaced by someone else when it was time for repair.\n\n“This cannot happen!” - said Kazem-Bek, after which he sat down at the table again. Obviously, the time has come to put long-conceived plans into action. To give the Russian people faith in the king and advice, to unite Russia again and lead it to true greatness.

Lieutenant Anton Leskov doesn't like escorting convoys - the road through the village of Karagay in Bereznyaki is very close to Permkhaim, and passing at night through the triangle of abandoned villages of Mendeleev-Beloborodovo-Grigoryevskoye makes him count the loaded magazines of his rifle every time. Usually, he catches the drivers' suspicious glances, but he doesn't care - only a hundred kilometers separate them from the lair of the Aryan Brotherhood, and it's better to keep an ear out. Yes - Anton doesn't like this job, but convoys with weapons and medicine are a sure guarantee that the province can defend itself, heal the wounded, and provide medicine for the sick.

For now, I only see the Council. We need to correct this. So, comrades, today's main and only question is: who will be our candidate for the throne?"\n\nKazem-Bek clapped his hands.

Everything is going according to plan, and soon we will be ready for the upcoming war with our southern 'neighbor'. The defensive strategy against the Aryan Brotherhood seems quite reasonable and does not need any changes. \n\nSuddenly, Belozersky entered the hall where Kazem-Bek was sitting with a report on the defense capabilities of the southern border. Belozersky stated that the creation of a defensive line would give little advantage in defense against the Aryan Brotherhood. As an example, he cited the Magino Line, which was simply bypassed. Thus, the defensive tactics, even if followed by a counterattack from our side, is not generally reliable. \n\nNodding in response to these explanations, Kazem-Bek asked, "What can we do to increase our chances of success?" In response, Sergey Sergeyevich Belozyorsky calmly summed up his thoughts: "We need to develop a new strategy from scratch, and I will personally ensure that it is done in the shortest possible time." Alexander Lvovich quickly agreed. \n\nBelozersky, retiring to his office, summoned senior generals and commanders. Explaining the situation with military strategy, he put forward a number of demands to the generals - to develop a new plan that would qualitatively differ from the old one. "You have a week." - declared Sergey Sergeyevich. \n\nA week later, the generals developed three plans. The first plan is based on a sharp and deep preventive strike, before the full deployment of the enemy forces. \n\nThe second plan was somewhat unconventional - the officer suggested letting the enemy invade our lands, after which we would surround the main divisions of the "Aryans" and thus gain a numerical advantage, while dealing a crushing blow to the enemy. \n\nThe third plan is the most questionable. Despite Belozersky's requirements, the general who developed it believes that we still need to alternate series of attacks and defense. He believes that only such a plan will allow us to quickly end the war with the Aryan Brotherhood. \n\nHowever, the final decision remains with Belozyorsky."

Without greetings, he immediately said:\n\n- Do you know anything about concessions? - The train driver didn't have time to open his mouth before he was interrupted:\n\n- Okay, don't answer, it's not important. What's important, young man, is that I just received a telegram from Bereznik. It says that these concessions were liquidated by our government. And that means you don't have to go to Vyatka.\n\n- What should I do then? - the train driver asked bewilderedly.\n\n- You must drive the empty train to the depot. Don't worry about unloading it, my assistant has already explained everything to the workers. They will receive 2 rates upon completion of the work. And you just wait. Thank you, you are free.\n\nNot understanding anything, he walked out into the corridor. After thinking for a couple of minutes, the train driver headed to the loading area, where work was already boiling again, but in the opposite direction. He still didn't understand the meaning of the telegram when sounds of gunfire rang out ahead. The workers' cry indicated that shooting was taking place near his train. Hurrying to the scene of the disorder, he saw three soldiers shooting at the cars of his train. Recovering from the shock, he became angry and was about to jump out from behind the fence, but quickly restrained himself. The soldiers were promptly disarmed by the station security. Approaching the violators, he asked about them. The security said that they were Vyatka soldiers who came to check the loading, but upon learning about the cancellation of concessions, decided to attack the train. Thanking the staff, he went to the train that had just been shot at."

Why did no one stop the soldiers, why did they easily pass the checkpoint, why did they enter the loading workshop without any problems... Too many questions, but there will be only one answer: answer to Vladimir.\n\nThe phone rang in the room. It was clear who it was. It was Vyatka. Moreover, an irritated but tactful voice of Vladimir, who would ask about what had happened, would come from there. "Can we deny everything? Maybe it's not ours? Maybe... No, complete nonsense," thought Kazem-Bek to himself. But the ringing distracted him from his thoughts, tirelessly notifying about Vladimir. "We need to act clearly and without panic!" - he realized when his hand had already treacherously brought the receiver to his ear.\n\n"Kazem-Bek speaking," he said calmly.\n"Well hello, my dear," a sarcastic voice said from the other end, "I didn't expect that I would have to talk to you today, but circumstances require it."\n"Circumstances are a monstrous mistake, Vladimir."\n"Of course it's a mistake, what else. And I am absolutely sure that my people are primarily responsible for what happened. But still, try to explain to me the reason for the arrest of my inspectors sent to the station last night. And I ask you to explain your decision to abolish the concessions."\n\nThere was a painful silence. Vladimir was clearly ahead, giving him the right to attack first and the right to make mistakes.

This same 'concession' gave the Vyatka industrialists the right to buy and export resources from Berezniki at laughably low prices.\n\nBut few of the loaders delved into the details of the economic relationship between the governorate and Vyatka. Many of the workers simply tried to earn a living through backbreaking labor that often led to accidents. But what could they do? They had agreed to this risk themselves. The train engineer was waiting for the exact departure time. There was still about half an hour left until departure.\n\nUnexpectedly, a voice came through the loudspeaker: "Train chief to the station. Quickly." In complete shock, the train chief arrived in the office after a short while. There sat a stout man waiting for him. But before he could say a word, 3 soldiers in Guard uniforms burst into the room.\n\n"You are arrested for treason! Boys, take him!" said the leader.\n\n"Wait! There's been a mistake! What have I done?" asked the station chief.\n\n"You are accused of treason for canceling His Majesty Vladimir III's concessions. You are arrested for this act of defiance!"\n\n"But it wasn't me who gave the order! It was a telegram!"\n\n"I'm not interested in why you did it. The fact is that you did it. Now get out!"\n\nCompletely bewildered, the train engineer walked back to the train, where the soldiers were yelling at the workers to load the remaining sacks faster.

Vitaliy's workday was also coming to an end. He had become accustomed to the work and was satisfied with his position as the head of the team. But even he was amazed at the amount of work that had to be done.\n\nThe norm gradually increased, including salaries and vacation days. He tried to explain all of this to his wife, but she still insisted on him quitting, as he hardly ever saw the children and did not participate in their upbringing. Sometimes their arguments escalated to the point of divorce threats, but nobody ever followed through. It seemed that the family would be ruined due to the father's overwork, but one day everything changed.\n\nThe evening sky calmed Marina down, as she drank tea with pastries in the kitchen. The children were already asleep, and she was also about to go to bed. But unexpectedly, the front door opened, and the head of the family entered the apartment. Marina's surprise knew no bounds.

They're already asleep!" the mother objected.\n"Oh, come on, for once I'm finally home on time, and I didn't come empty-handed!"\n\nFinishing his sentence, he pulled out a heavy package of groceries from behind his back. At that moment, the children ran out of the room and hugged their father. Surprised Marina was speechless once again but also ran to hug her husband. \n"Vitya, where did you get this?" she asked happily.\n"They gave it out at work for overtime. As the head of the team, I was given the most, and the guys chipped in since it's true that I've been working overtime the most, and all the responsibility lies with me."\n\nOnce they had calmed down, they all sat down at the table to feed their breadwinner dinner."

It was class 7G. Most of the students in it were normal children, and only a few were recently assigned to it. But the homeroom teacher - a young woman named Irina Konstantinovna - was still tense due to such a sudden influx of students that occurred during the current academic year.\n\nBut soon everyone calmed down and the principal gave a solemn speech about the importance of education and that it is now available to everyone. Of course, the government of Kosygin, which contributed to this reform, could not be overlooked. Soon the assembly ended and the classes headed to their classrooms.\n\nOne of them was Irina's 7G. Her excitement was visible to the naked eye, so Deputy Oleg Ignatyevich decided to help her by escorting her class to the auditorium. Everyone sat in their places when the bell rang.

And even though this contact with the outside world was extremely short, it managed to destroy all the manifestations of sleep in him. Grumbling, he sat up in bed and looked at the shelf. It was still 6 in the morning. Too early for his usual self, too late for his adventurous self. But he had a plan for the day.\n\nWhile he reluctantly did his exercises, he couldn't resist his mother's persuasion - when she says something, it means it's necessary. Then he washed up and went to the kitchen with a dissatisfied expression. Nothing was ready yet. The kettle had just been placed on the stove, and the pan was being heated for an omelette. He sat down at the table and reread his literature textbook once again, just to avoid his mother's scolding.\n\nBut time passed quickly, and soon Dan had successfully consumed his full breakfast. There was nothing to do at home, so he changed clothes, grabbed his school supplies, and headed to school. But in reality, he didn't want to go to school today because a civil defense test was scheduled, and he hated that subject. But since his parents' trust limit was exhausted, and it was difficult to come up with something tricky, he and his friend Kolya decided to quietly leave for the village to spend the whole day there.\n\nThe plan, as it seemed, was perfect. Some friends were bribed by truants to tell Irina Konstantinovna that they had gone to the city with their families, so there was no need to worry about skipping school. Besides, it wouldn't be easy to find them. Together, they decided to hide behind the village in an old hut on the lake shore. But the main question remained - where was Kolya? He didn't show up at the appointed time. "What a friend! He betrayed me!" Dan cursed in his heart when suddenly Nikolai appeared out of nowhere and said, "What are you waiting for? The bell will ring soon. Let's go!"\n\nSo they left the village. Walking along the dirt road, they chatted about various things, joked, and laughed. In other words, the plan was successful. Everything was going smoothly until they heard a strange noise in the distance. Stopping, they listened. The sound was strange, unlike anything they had ever heard. But what was frightening was that it was quickly approaching. Soon the rumbling stopped, and it seemed like nothing had happened when suddenly a deafening explosion rang out close by. Then another one. And another one!\n\nPlanes with crosses on their fuselages flashed in the sky. "GERMANS!" Kolya shouted and ran along the road. Dan was also in shock, but through millions of thoughts, he remembered a small excerpt from a civil defense lesson when Irina Konstantinovna said that during an air raid, you should lie in a sheltered place and cover your head with your hands. Remembering such simple truths, Dan instantly dragged his friend by the scruff of his neck into a ravine, where they both lay down. Literally a second later, the nearby building was destroyed by a bomb from one of the planes.\n\nSoon the nightmare was over. The planes flew away, but the boys didn't come out of the wet ditch for half an hour, afraid of a repeat. Finally, they realized that there was nothing there and crawled out.

Her attempt to get up ended with a heavy wet rag falling on her head, and from above came the words: \nCome on, work off your place in the army! \nI don't have to work off anything! - Arina protested.\nYou bitch! - he roared, pressing her against the wall.\nWhat are you doing, let me go!\n\nBut he didn't hear anything anymore. Covering her mouth with his hand, he began to take off her uniform, when suddenly a blow to the back of his head followed. A second of silence, and the senior soldier fell to the floor.

But almost all of the passengers didn't notice it and calmly went about their business: someone was cleaning their weapon from clogged dirt, someone was telling stories to their comrades in misfortune, and someone even managed to sleep while bouncing every ten seconds. The road went on and on, seemingly without end or edge, so they had no choice but to wait... \n\nBut one day was unusual. Typical Russian landscapes were replaced by villages and small towns. Finally, in the second half of the day, the column entered a city. Admiring the city, they were surprised at the level of development of the Russians, as they thought that Russia was just ashes of past greatness burned by the fire of the Third Reich. Getting off at the central square, the conductor said, "Welcome to Berezniki!"\n\nThere, a small group of people, probably soldiers, was already waiting for them. It was evident from their uniforms. In the end, about 100 American mercenaries got out of the eight trucks, exhausted from the week-long trip. Despite their fatigue, they stood in formation and greeted their comrades from Berezniki. The commander of the unit, King, came out with an interpreter to talk to the head of the welcoming party. \n\nThe interpreter approached the Russians and asked for their leader to speak with. From the crowd stepped out Sergei Sergeevich Belozersky. After shaking hands, the conversation began:\n\n- Greetings to you in Berezniki! - started Belozersky.\n- I wish you good health, comrade! - said the interpreter.\n- Well, as I see, you are ready to start serving in the depths of Russia!\n- Exactly!\n- That's great, but I would like to personally meet with the personnel, sorry for the tautology.\n- Nothing to worry about. I just wanted to ask for your name.\n- Oh, sorry, I forgot. I'm Sergei Sergeevich Belozersky!\n\nUnexpectedly, a few heads popped out of the even formation of Americans. Looking at the Minister of Defense, they were nervous. The commander was about to yell at his subordinates, but he was unexpectedly interrupted by Belozersky himself.\n- My goodness! Fred! And Gilbert!\n\nHugging each other warmly, Sergei tried to explain the situation. It turns out that these were his old acquaintances from the time of the war in Britain. He had already given up hope of seeing them again, and here such happiness happened. Quickly saying goodbye to the arrivals and leaving them to the mercy of the Bereznikov forces, Belozersky and his comrades in arms rushed to their car to spend a few hours with warm conversations about the past."

The cargo had arrived here through the ports of Brauchichstadt, whose local docks had been bribed by the CIA's European office. And now the cargo was moving through scorched wastelands to deliver supplies to Berezniki. But before the end of these adventures, the convoy had to pass one of the most critical tests of the entire trip - the Vyatka customs officials.\n\nDue to some radical actions of the governorship, the trust between Vladimir and Bek had catastrophically deteriorated, which tightened all levels of control at the borders. Due to fears of smuggling and the preparation of reinforcement for Berezniki, Vladimir ordered to check every convoy going along the route to Berezniki. This factor became decisive in creating the "Humanitarian Mission of Emigrants from the USA".\n\nThe checkpoint emerged unexpectedly from the fog. It was a complex of several buildings where several stages of checks had to be carried out. Due to the high risk, it was decided not to offer bribes and go, so to speak, completely clean. After stopping the convoy, the customs officer decided to go along with the main convoy and check them. As they went further, they saw only the top-loaded bodies with boxes piled on top of each other. \n\nBut then they came to some semi-empty car, and the customs officer decided to climb in and check something for himself. A brief inspection of the contents, if it could be called that, caused great excitement among the two drivers. It became clear that the adventure was going down the drain when a soldier pulled one of the boxes from the top onto the floor of the body and asked to open it. Holding their breath, everyone stood silently, watching the lid of the box slowly opening. It seemed that something irreversible was about to happen. Mentally, everyone was saying goodbye if not to their lives, then certainly to their freedom...\n\nBut unexpectedly, the soldier took out a children's book and a can of American stew from the box. Taking what he found, he thanked them for the gifts and said that they could pass."

We'll find you.'\n\nHe got this note after a lecture at the institute of the division where he was studying. Nikolai, smart and physically fit beyond his years, was one of the best on the entire course.\n\nHe didn't understand the meaning of the note but decided to come to the meeting place anyway and wait for some citizen who, most likely, wrote this text. It was Saturday and there was nothing else to do, so no other courses suffered. But time passed, and no one appeared.

He's in the examination room here,' Nikolai lied, considering revealing the true meaning a mistake.\n'Oh, waiting for a friend? Well, he just asked you to accompany him. Will you do it?'\n'Okay,' he said, finally understanding that this was exactly the person he was waiting for.\n\nQuickly leaving the polyclinic, they headed somewhere. The student didn't want to ask anything, as he didn't know the rules of the game and just silently agreed with the leader. Thus, they came to one of the houses standing next to the square. Entering it, Nikolai wanted to ask a question but refrained. 'It's not worth destroying the conspiracy,' he reasoned. They went up to the 2nd floor, entered a typical apartment, and went to the kitchen.\n\n'Tea?' the stranger asked.\n'No, thanks.'\n'Well then, okay.'\n'Excuse me, but can I ask you a couple of questions?'

So, I am a representative of the CIA special forces in Beryozniki for training new personnel, and I think you will fit in perfectly there.'\n'The CIA? So, do I understand correctly that you are offering me to join the special forces unit and train there?'\n'Exactly, young man. You are suitable both physically and mentally.

Learn again!"\n\nWith these words, Belozersky began the meeting at the army headquarters in Berezniki. As can be understood from the text, the main concepts of the new doctrine for the army were to be formed at this meeting. To study a huge amount of works from the past years, Anatoly Vavilov, an old acquaintance of Minister Bayerli and a former officer of the Soviet Army, was invited. Belozersky believed that his knowledge of the Soviet Army would undoubtedly be useful in creating the doctrine.\n\nHowever, the process of studying was tedious and lengthy, and the meeting soon turned into an evening in the library. Complete silence was accompanied by the sound of pages turning and a writing pencil. Books were flipped through one by one, and some thought was extracted from each, but even this volume provided a huge amount of information that had to be structured and rethought in a new way.\n\nCloser to midnight, the pile of read specimens of Soviet samples was growing in a geometric progression, and the bookish ammunition was approaching the end. Notebooks brought to the meeting by Belozersky, Bayerli, and Vavilov were already seriously filled with notes, which was a good factor - the more information, the more accurate the new army doctrine would be established. But finally, all three were sitting next to high stacks of books they had just read.\n"Well, I suggest summing up the meeting," said the minister.\n"I agree with you," said Bayerli.\n"Same here," muttered Vavilov briefly.\nAs there was a huge amount of material collected, I suggest passing it on to the documentation department, where it will be structured and comprehended.

You understand the whole situation, but we can't help.

In my opinion, this was the main mistake of the leadership of the Red Army, which focused not so much on preparing for the operation as on the fruits of revenge. \n\nAfter these words, silence reigned in the office, interrupted only by the ticking of the clock. Gil and Belozersky looked at Frunze, who was pacing back and forth in the corner, and pondered his words. They were now gathered in a room at the Military Institute and were discussing the West Russian War and the reasons for the defeat of one side and the victory of the other. \nBut allow me to disagree, - said Belozersky, - You claim that the blame for the defeat is concentrated in the consciousness of the leadership of the Red Army. \nYes, - said Frunze, - Moreover, I can say that if the leadership had done everything properly, rather than following their hearts, it is quite possible that we could have seen the rebirth of the Soviet Union. \nWell, colleague, I'm afraid I have to disappoint you, - Belozersky replied, - Your view seems too positive and optimistic to me. Undoubtedly, the Soviet Army could have avoided such a debacle and might have even convinced Berlin to come to the negotiating table. But there is an important detail here - the Wehrmacht. Although I am not a historian, I still think that at least the Bolsheviks did not have enough equipment for such a devastating defeat of the Germans. Their technologies were fairly advanced, and they could have given enough resistance with coordinated and correct leadership. \nMoreover, - unexpectedly picked up Gil, - we should not forget about dissidents among the ranks of the Red Army. I hope that no one will argue that Germany conducted a masterful recruitment of various Russian figures, who subsequently played an important role in the collapse of the army's combat readiness. Vladimir 3, Vlasov, various small officials, and other traitors were able to successfully destroy the entire organization and combat readiness, which led us to a repeat of the results of Boris Godunov's rule. \nWell, - said Frunze, - each of us has our own point of view on the WRR. We should not deny that everyone is right in something and wrong in something. And this is not worth a second of discussion between us. The bottom line is simple: the defeat of the Red Army was caused by a number of factors that we unfortunately cannot or do not want to see. A toast, comrades:"

The sun had long been shining in the barracks, but it was not the one that woke up the soldiers who had been sleeping there since 10 PM. Boots creaked under the weight of a person walking into the room. Soon the sounds died down, only to be replaced a moment later by a thunderous: "GET UP!" The soldiers instantly jumped out of their beds and hurriedly began to get dressed, and then made their beds just as hastily. Although doing it quickly was quite difficult, they couldn't relax. The commander of the company's shouts echoed in their ears: "Hurry up! You have no time at all. This is peacetime for you. And what if there's an alarm? Or something even worse? Huh?" Fortunately, everyone quickly lined up and was ready to follow the commander's orders. The orders, honed to automatism, were executed quickly, after which everyone went to "washing and cleaning" procedures. Cold water, cold air, cold relations with each other after the rise - everything created an uncomfortable but familiar and understandable atmosphere for everyone.\n\nThe soldiers didn't stay long at the washbasins, so they soon stood in formation on the parade ground. The commander walked nervously back and forth, chewing on his cigarette. It was clear that something important was going to happen. But finally, a car appeared at the other end of the huge concrete field, quickly approaching the formation. In a couple of minutes, it had stopped in front of the company. A young military lad of about 25 got out of the car, cheerfully greeting the company commander. "Greetings, Comrade Arshinov," he said, holding his hand up to his temple. "Good to see you, Comrade Shchiptsov," Arshinov replied. "Well, then," said Shchiptsov, turning to the soldiers, "Greetings, comrades in arms." "Greetings, Comrade Shchiptsov!" rang out across the parade ground. "Allow me to introduce Afanasy Ignatievich Shchiptsov, the political officer attached to our company, as of today.

The MGB is doing everything in its power to prevent the influence of the criminal king. Please understand the measures taken.

In addition to performing his direct work duties, his job was to report on the internal situation in Bereznikov. And those two armed men were agents of Bereznikov counterintelligence, this was not the first search, but until now, everything had gone smoothly. Recently, the situation in Bereznikov had been heating up, but the agent managed to avoid being exposed. \n\nUntil today. \n\n"Comrades, how long can this go on?!

But after 3 seconds, Alexander pulled himself together and had the courage to take the phone and put it to his ear.\n\nThe conversation between the governor and Vladimir began, and judging by the tone of the conversation, it could be understood that "Big Brother" was not satisfied with what Kazem-Bek was doing behind his back. When asked how the Tsar found out about everything, he invariably answered: "the birds sang". Alexander realized that the influence of the Tsar was too great on Berezniki, and in order to bargain for himself a second chance, he had to justify himself for a long time and painfully, making up everything on the fly, just to not lose his position.\n\nPerhaps coming up with a dozen justifications, he still managed to bargain for himself a second chance at life and the existence of Berezniki. Vladimir said he would forgive him for these antics, but only once, and demanded that this not happen again, otherwise...\n\nPutting down the phone, Kazem-Bek sighed calmly, but the thought that he could not break free from under Vladimir's heel oppressed him. This indicates that the influence of the Tsar is too strong, and that one should act even more covertly.

The goal of this person was to carry out an order from Tsar Vladimir III - to capture Kazem-Bek and execute him for treason to the Tsar.\n\nAfter a few hours of travel, Solzhenitsyn and his detachment surrounded Kazem-Bek's residence, and he himself with his people entered the building. Upon entering the building, they arrested all members of the government and disarmed the guards. The last to remain was Kazem-Bek.\n\n- These are the troops of His Imperial Majesty Vladimir III. We call on Kazem-Bek to resign from his duties and leave this office! Otherwise, we will break down the door and come in!\n\nInstead of simply surrendering, Kazem-Bek decided to resist until the very end. Having taken out his loaded pistol, he aimed at the door from which this small detachment was supposed to come. Not receiving any response, Solzhenitsyn ordered to break down the door, but the door was of good quality, and in order not to waste time, he simply ordered to blow it up with a grenade.\n\nThe grenade explosion slightly stunned Kazem-Bek, but he immediately realized that the storming of his office had begun. Apparently, this was the end of Alexander, so he decided to shoot all the bullets in the magazine at the people.\n\nAs soon as the dust settled, the shooting began. Judging by the sound, Kazem-Bek hit one of the soldiers, but the other bullets apparently missed and only hit around these soldiers. The soldiers, however, fired their automatic weapons into the room, hitting Kazem-Bek in the upper part of his body. Several bullet wounds made Alexander weak, and he fell to the floor.\n\nSolzhenitsyn approached Kazem-Bek and he said:\n- I'm sorry for you.

He began his activities aimed at returning power to the hands of the Mladorossi, and he immediately announced to all armed forces in Bereznik that the army was marching on the city. The army immediately sided with Gil and followed him into the city.\n\nAll attempts to stop Vladimir Gil and Solzhenitsyn were unsuccessful - the small detachment that he had was defeated by Gil's regular forces. Continuing on their way to the city, the residents of the country supported the general in every way on the way to Bereznik.\n\nTwo days later, Vladimir Gil's troops began to surround the city, making sure that no one entered or left. Vladimir Gil and his small detachment entered the city and destroyed the last survivors of Solzhenitsyn's army, and later reached the very residence where the old Bereznik government was located.

Near the gate to the courtyard, Kazem-Bek's guards scrutinized the armed monks with a dissatisfied look. There was something amazing about the fact that neither time nor German bombers could destroy this building. Frankly, he did not imagine his meeting with the Grand Master of the Order of St. George this way. He hoped that his diplomats would conduct negotiations in a lavishly decorated church. Although Antipin had formally agreed to negotiations through intermediaries, he still demanded a personal meeting with Kazem-Bek. Perhaps he was too reckless, or an idealist who fervently believed in his ideas. In any case, it was strange behavior for the leader of the warrior monks. Soon, the leader of the Mladorossi managed to find the courage to knock on the door. The door opened, and a man dressed in monastic robes stood in the doorway. "Please come in, be my guest." The hut was not richly furnished, with only a bed and a table with a stove inside. The only decoration was the icons, of which there were plenty. A heated samovar and a pair of cups were already on the table. Michael started the conversation at the table.\n\n- You want my people to join you, if I understand correctly, the Grand Master began.\n\n- That's exactly why I came here - the regent replied dryly.\n\n- Well then, I will ask you a couple of important questions for me. I hope you don't mind. Do you want to bring the councils back to Russian soil? The same ones that were used by the power of the godless Bukharin. The ones that chopped off the heads of dissenters with a sickle and destroyed churches with a hammer. Do you really want this to happen again in Russia?\n\n- No, not at all. The councils themselves are not something bad. The problem was with the authorities of the Union. And we will not let the councils go astray, and don't forget, the main face of the country will be the Tsar, and his will will be the law.\n\n- Interesting system you've come up with after all! Maybe it can work... But a naked idea is not enough. Will you be able to rebuild Russia, pull it out of the kingdom of darkness, are your intentions pure? \n\n- You can have no doubt about that - with these words, the Mladorossi pulled out a photograph from his pocket.\n\n- So it was thanks to you that I hadn't heard of the Aryans for so long? Wagner and his gang... ... they deserved it.\n\nAfter these words, the conversation continued for several more hours. The monk and the Mladorossi talked about Russia, God, and fate.

I don't know what to do with them. Antipin said he would support me, but everything is moving slowly.\n\n- Well, Sasha, what's going on? I know they haven't integrated well into the army and I came here to talk about that, but it seems that things are much worse.\n\n- Yes, if it was just the army. They're rebelling against the introduction of the soviets, and the locals are refusing to let our people into their settlements. I'm close to just disbanding them all.\n\n- Hold on. If you disband them, you'll have another war in your country, especially considering that they've gained access to weapons. You need to approach this carefully, understand?\n\n- Yes, you're right, it seems like we'll have to integrate them slowly.

The speaker approached the microphone, instantly capturing the attention of the crowd, and began chanting: \n\n"Listen to me, everyone!

The ideas that you offer to desperate people carry only further devastation and decline for our great Motherland. Without even knowing it, you have already lost the most important battle - the battle with the present, your ideas are left on the sidelines of progress. Just look at the former collaborators in Samara, can traitors offer you a new homeland? A homeland that you can be proud of, and for which you can die with a clear conscience? And what can the Bolsheviks in the north offer you? They could not protect you in the Great Patriotic War, they could not defeat the Nazis in the West Russian War, and now they cannot even feed themselves, how much longer can you tolerate this?! The Mladorossi movement is different from these worthless politicians, generals, and embezzlers. Unlike them, we are not afraid to embrace new ideas, our new ideology is in step with the times. We, the Mladorossi movement, want to declare this as openly and directly as possible - your path is already over, it is in your own interests to stop resisting and lay down your weapons.

Where did you get such an unusual patronymic - Ilysurovich? \n- Come on, Sanya, you have no idea? I am a Tatar, but half of it. My father's name was Ilysur, he fought with the Fritz, and not bad at all, received some kind of medal, then caught a shrapnel, and then in the hospital with my mother they met. \n- All right, enough, I get it. And do you know Tatar? \n- Nope, in our family we only spoke Russian, my father was not a big fan of Tatar culture. He taught me like this - the main thing is that the person is normal, and everything else is secondary. \nSanya raised his eyes to the sky, looking at the clouds above them. \n- Your father said the right things.

Starting from his contemplation of the current WRRF, he began to delve deeper into memories, reaching the West-Russian War, the Great Patriotic War, the 30s and the 20s, and finally the year 1917.\n\nRecalling himself and what was happening in those days, Kazem-Bek was once again convinced that there is a lot in common between the Mladorossians and the communists of the current WRRF. For example, closeness of power to the people. Power under the Communists was much closer to the people than under Nicholas II. The Mladorossians want to make the power just as close, but with a Tsar. Only in this way can harmony and prosperity be achieved within the country.\n\nIt is worth acknowledging that the Communists believed in the right things, at least fixing many questions of the imperial past. And even though Bukharin suffered a devastating defeat in the Great Patriotic War, many still believe in socialism. If it had not succeeded, then everyone would have forgotten about it immediately, but instead there are people throughout Russia who believe in communism. In Tyumen, on Baikal, even in Central Siberia. And now, in Arkhangelsk, there are their own followers.\n\nBut alas, even they differ from us in their views. They do not want to see a Tsar, while we want to make a people's monarch. The Reds look at us, probably, as at a pawn of Viatka, who picked up their strange ideas and still want to put a Tsar. Moreover, they still remember how we fought against our own people on the side of the Germans and Vladimir III, and they perceive us as collaborators, like those who were in Samara.\n\nOn these and other issues, we strongly differ from WRRF, and they perceive us as enemies who need to be destroyed right now. They will attack sooner or later, and there is no need to have illusions that this will not happen.

Many of them, as expected, refused to switch to the side of their enemies and to personally support Kazem-Bek. For the sake of interest, we asked them why they made this decision. Many of them said they did not like the idea of a king in itself, as it means a return to monarchy, which already harmed the country in the past. And even though they remember that we destroyed Vyatka by that time, they do not believe in the justice of our cause.\n\nBelozersky reported this to Kazem-Bek. The latter, in clear contemplation, makes a decision - to announce amnesty for generals, commanders, and soldiers of the revolutionary front in exchange for ceasing any activity against Bereznikov.

Through our efforts, we were able to turn Beresniki from semi-ruins into a flourishing city with industry and, as a result, a fairly good economy. However, the need to move the capital to a new city has been talked about for quite some time now. In the new Mladorossi Russia, which is united under the banner of Beresniki, this seems somewhat frivolous to many. Even the fact that our enemies have been defeated and everyone else has started to look at our glorious city with respect does not negate the fact that we need a larger and more prestigious capital. Larger in terms of size and population, and prestigious in terms of its notoriety worldwide. Everyone knows the names of such capitals as Germany, Moscow, London, Washington, and others - we also need to have a city like that, and Beresniki on their background seems very insignificant. But this is not even the main problem. The main problem is that with the expansion of our country, it has become too big for the current apparatus. The administration simply cannot cope with such a volume of work, and expansion, frankly speaking, is not profitable. In addition, there are not enough people and economic power in Beresniki to maintain the existing power in Russia. It is time to seriously consider the question of moving to a new capital. Among all the cities that exist in Western Russia, the most suitable options are only Syktyvkar - the capital of the former Komi Republic and Vyatka - the capital of the overthrown Vladimir III, which are both equally well suited to the role of capital.

Surprisingly, even in peacetime, Kazem-Bek had to solve hundreds of different caliber issues. But the biggest question at the moment was the question of the Zemsky Sobor.\n\nHe had already determined the place for holding the Zemsky Sobor. But now it is necessary to understand on what principle the electoral college will be created. This question, in fact, is not the most trivial, since according to Kazem-Bek, this can greatly divide the political elites. In our state, the military have a very large influence - it is they who united Russia under the banner of Mladorossians. They will certainly want to have weight to their words at the upcoming Zemsky Sobor. We also have very strong industrialists who have begun to appropriate more and more factories and who can easily influence the decisions of this Sobor. In addition, the Mladorossian party itself has never been on the sidelines of politics, and their opinion also needs to be taken into account. And, of course, the people, who are more of a means for these elections, if you can put it that way, should not be deprived either.\n\nKazem-Bek already has a roughly ready template for the upcoming Sobor. Alexander was also inspired by the principle by which the Sobor was convened in 1613, when the fate of the country as a whole was being decided. He came to the conclusion that it is necessary to try to implement this same principle, but with adjustments to the current situation and realities of the 20th century.\n\nAfter reflection, he came to the conclusion that the Sobor itself should consist of 200 delegate-people. The first 100 people are representatives of the people. The people vote for them by a majoritarian system, who should represent the interests of their district. If a certain district votes for a particular candidate, then this representative receives a mandate from their district and gives a vote already at the Zemsky Sobor.\n\nThe remaining 100 people are representatives of the military, industrialists, and prominent party leaders who choose who to vote for themselves. They replaced the outdated concept of "boyars," which we have not had in our country for probably more than three centuries. These 200 people will ultimately have to vote for a certain candidate."

Belozersky is a good candidate for the Russian throne due to his close relationship with the Rurik dynasty. He is in the 19th generation of relation to them, which is a significant support for him to claim the Russian throne as such.\n\nSergey is also a very experienced commander. During World War I, he proved himself as a good administrator, serving as a staff-captain in the horse guard-guards. Later on, he joined Yudenich's army as the chief of staff of the II corps. After the Civil War, he went to the United States and served there as a major in the Air Force, and after the fall of the USSR and the defeat of the West Russian Front, he returned to Bereznyaky.\n\nDespite his relatively rich military experience and proximity to the Rurik dynasty, he was nevertheless considered a rather mediocre figure until recently.\n\nWith the start of the "Battle for Western Russia," he gained quite serious influence among the military elite, proving himself to be an exceptionally outstanding leader and commander. His army, if not adoring him, at least respects him for what he himself has done to win this battle for Russia. In addition, the people who witnessed the rise of the Mladorossi saw that it was not so much the will of Kazem-Bek alone as the efforts of Sergey Belozersky that made it happen.\n\nMoreover, not only does the people in general respect Belozersky, but the party itself does as well. He is one of the old members of the Mladorossi party, and even there, he has good connections and, as a result, support.\n\nFinally, he may have very serious chances of getting votes from the economic elites who own the military-industrial complex. These industrialists see a great opportunity to earn extra money in Belozersky, and therefore they will generally be ready to give their votes to this person.\n\nAll in all, if we consider his chances, they have recently become much greater, and we can already assume that he will become the ruler of Western Russia as a result of the Zemsky Sobor."

 MAR_zemsky_sobor.5.d:0 "Maria Romanova, who is only 10 years old, has serious claims to the Russian throne. She is a representative of the royal family, which was overthrown about half a century ago. As strange as it may sound, the mention of the Romanovs among the general population in recent times evokes, if not nostalgic feelings, then at least respect and honor. Even during the time of Bukharin, a serious campaign was carried out to defame the Romanov family, but it was not effective enough. Even the fact that Vladimir III was a true collaborator with the Nazis evokes far from unambiguous feelings among the population.\n\nMaria, even at the age of 10, technically can claim the Russian throne. But she will not be able to rule, as her age does not allow her to do so. If we take a brief look at the chances of becoming Tsarina, it might create the impression that she has more chances than Belozersky. But if we pay attention to the circumstances of her young age, this can seriously change the balance of power in favor of Sergey. And even if she becomes Tsarina, she will not be able to govern the country properly.\n\nThere is a solution that significantly simplifies the situation. Kazem-Bek is already acting as regent, but he will represent Maria as this very regent and the second person in the state. Here is a very interesting thing happening - if Kazem-Bek is nominated as Maria's regent, it may turn out that people will vote not for Maria herself, but for Alexander Kazem-Bek. Kazem-Bek is very popular among the ordinary people, as he mostly united Russia, although not without the help of Belozersky. Among the people, it is believed that it was Kazem-Bek who developed the policies, while Sergey Belozersky only implemented Alexander's ideas. And of course, there is an opinion that Kazem-Bek should continue to rule the country for the above reasons. This opinion is supported by the fact that such a skillful person in managing the country should rule Russia for as long as possible, since it is unacceptable to allow another collapse in Western Russia, as happened after the West-Russian War.\n\nOf course, such a situation is likely to be advantageous for Kazem-Bek, who may not want to leave politics so quickly after all he has done. So this "coalition" of Maria-Bek is quite strong. But again, Kazem-Bek will be the ruler only until Maria becomes independent and begins to govern the country herself.

What if the people cannot decide who to vote for? This is quite possible, I know this from my own experience. - Kosygin told Kazem-Bek. After a moment of silence, he continued. - I could become a new candidate for the Russian throne. Remembering this newspaper, I can justify my claim to the throne and will be known as Alexei Romanov.\n\nAfter thinking for a moment, Kazem-Bek said:\n\n- Honestly, I can offer you to become the next candidate in case the votes are split evenly between those who vote for Romanova and those who vote for Belozersky. - Kazem-Bek said. - That is, you will be a figure that either takes away votes or you will become the ruler after the Zemsky Sobor, because you will be a consolidating figure in Russia.\n\n- So you are really giving me the opportunity to become a candidate? - Kosygin asked with some concern.\n\n- Yes, it turns out so.

His cooperative was one of the few profitable ones during Bukharin's time, and later he also owned a textile factory in Leningrad, but after the Great Patriotic War, he ended up in the Republic of Komi, where a democratic regime was established.\n\nRecently, a rumor has emerged in Komi that Kosygin is actually Alexey Romanov - miraculously survived on the night of July 16-17, 1918. The newspaper that appeared in Komi caused a certain furor because there are quite weighty evidence in favor of the fact that Kosygin is indeed Romanov. Starting from fairly close facial features, ending with characteristic features of character and mind-set of Alexey Romanov. At the same time, everything is explained by the fact that supposedly Alexey Romanov became the adopted son of Bukharin and he gave him a new history and surname. This could explain a lot, for example, why Kosygin-Romanov was very wealthy during the Soviet era.\n\nNevertheless, many have questions about this theory, and many considered it a joke, but some seriously believed it. And some were vehemently opposed. Nevertheless, according to Kazem-Bek, this is a sufficient reason for him to become a candidate for the Russian throne through the Zemsky Sobor.\n\nHis chances of becoming a ruler are very slim. This is because, again, Kosygin is primarily known as Kosygin, and the newspaper about his affiliation with the Romanovs is known only in Komi. What is known about Kosygin himself is that he is very close to the people and very democratic in solving issues, and his merits in Komi are more known than rumors about his affiliation with the Romanovs. His power, even if he suddenly comes to power, will have low legitimacy, as the people are very skeptical of him as Romanov. For the same reason, he is not very popular among the military structure and the intelligentsia. The only somewhat support he has is from industrialists who believe that Kosygin will be soft on state control of the economy, but it is weaker than that of Belozersky."

Answering the question of why he was presenting the future candidate Romanov's program, he replied that it was much easier to convey the program to the people in this way, as not everyone reads such paper works dedicated to politicians' promises for the future.\n\nThe program developed by Kosygin-Romanov was called "Every person is a Tsar." The title of this program indicated that under Kosygin-Romanov, every person in Russia would live like a Tsar. The program specified a number of solutions aimed at developing the country's well-being, such as introducing allowances, pensions, minimum wages, and so on. It was necessary for the citizens of Russia to be well-fed, clothed, and employed, so that there would be no problems in society and to achieve many accomplishments in other spheres of society, but the foundation of the new Russia would be the well-being of every citizen. And all this would be guaranteed by Tsar Alexey Romanov. What could be the problem with this concept?\n\nThe announcer had a question about where to get so much money for all these projects. Kosygin-Romanov replied that all of this could be implemented in Russia due to its natural resources. Russia is so rich that it can be used for the benefit of the people, and that is why he proposes to do so. Wealth, contrary to popular belief, will not be wasted. This wealth, which goes to the people, will return to the state in the form of taxes and additional costs of goods, and it will circulate in the economy.\n\nThe announcer asked Kosygin-Romanov a final question: "As far as we know, American politician Huey Long had a similar program called 'Every man a king.'

This influence is also evident in the fact that they can now elect a new Tsar, and of course, they will try to vote for someone who is willing to give a lot of money to the army. Sergei Belozersky is currently the favorite among the army.\n\nSergei Belozersky is not only respected and revered in the army, but he is also loved because his interests coincide with the army - he is ready to spend millions, if not billions of rubles, to maintain the army in the highest condition and further unite Russia. The army, by voting for Belozersky, rather than, say, Maria, who is also willing to spend money on the army, but on a smaller scale, is choosing the best path for themselves.\n\nIf we want to get some of the military electorate, we need to make an offer equivalent to Belozersky's expectations. Kosygin-Romanov, speaking on another radio broadcast of "Glas Rossii," talked about what he would do with the army. He reasoned about how much the army is needed in modern realities and came to the conclusion that the army is needed especially in the current reality because enemies still surround Western Russia. The presence of a strong army today is a guarantee of the independence of the state and it is also she who can protect the well-being of citizens. After that, he came to the conclusion that an army is needed that is not so much massive as it is modern and first-class. It should be ready for all cases of war, and extra skills won't hurt. But in addition to that, it will need modern weapons, because current weapons are starting to become obsolete. We need first-class weapons that will give an advantage over the enemy for decades to come. Therefore, Kosygin-Romanov indicated that it will be necessary to develop new weapons, and if necessary, even super weapons.\n\nAfter this radio broadcast, the military began to seriously consider voting not for Belozersky, but for Kosygin-Romanov. Although half of the voters from the military doubted Kosygin-Romanov's military plans, the other part still thought that it was worth voting for Alexei. In the end, the votes in this electorate were split between Belozersky and Kosygin-Romanov."

That's why we need a good campaign."

 MAR_zemsky_sobor.17.d:0 "Alexey Kosygin, who decided to take on the role of the surviving Romanov, is undoubtedly an experienced politician who deeply understands the people. In Komi, he represented a real force, which further confirms his effectiveness. However, outside of Komi, he was not as well-known as he is in Syktyvkar, and the people do not know him fully. Moreover, the people do not believe that Alexey Romanov could have survived, which also affects his popularity among the general public.\n\nAlexey Kosygin needs to declare himself as the surviving heir of Nicholas II to all of Western Russia. To convincingly demonstrate to the population that he is indeed the surviving heir, he needs not just agitation, but to walk among the people. He needs to become more well-known and popular than he is now. He needs to appear on the radio and television more often than before. In general, he needs to fill all the free information space with his speeches and demonstrate himself as Alexey Romanov.\n\nThis can only be done with the help of connections with media magnates. Therefore, Kosygin contacted Georgy Sergeev, the owner of several TV and radio stations in Berezniki, Artem Konovalov, the owner of several newspapers, and Kirill Biryukov, the manager of several print media outlets. After contacting them, Alexey Kosygin convinced them to work for him and to start helping him promote himself among the people.\n\nFor example, thanks to Konovalov's help, Kosygin-Romanov began to appear very often on the front page of newspapers. Usually, news reports indicate what he did for the people - for example, by visiting one of the villages, he donated a tractor for the entire village, and now the village can use it to improve the irrigated land. Or, for example, he made a donation of several thousand rubles to the fund for orphans of the Great Patriotic War and the West Russian War. Remarkably, all of this really happens, but not so much thanks to Romanov himself, but thanks to his sponsors.\n\nOn the radio in the next episode of "Voice of Russia", hosted by Georgy Sergeev, Kosygin-Romanov was invited as a special guest. The "Voice of Russia" announcer asked Kosygin-Romanov questions that interested the people. One such question was: "Is it true that you were actually the adopted son of Bukharin himself?" to which Kosygin-Romanov replied: "Yes, that's right," and began to describe in detail the circumstances of what happened. At first glance, this seems absolutely impossible, but the longer the listeners listened to the words of Kosygin-Romanov, the fewer questions they had. At least for now."

And even a dispute could have arisen, but SHE prevented it.\n\nMaria Vladimirovna herself appeared before the public of the upper classes. She descended from the balcony into the hall, or rather 'from heaven to earth,' dressed in an ivory-colored dress, white gloves, a modest but charming hairstyle with exposed necks and shoulders. She descended the stairs and greeted everyone present. In the hall, she began to talk to everyone about everything, and judging by the expressions of those she talked to, they were very pleased. \n\nAnd so, an hour passed at the ball.

They started with a polonaise, where the 'gentlemen' chose their 'ladies.' Maria intrigued everyone with her simple, light, and romantic movements: the gentlemen picked up their ladies by the waist and spun them around the hall. And then came the waltz... lots of waltzing. Even at the end, where traditionally they had to dance a cotillion, everyone started waltzing!\n\nNow the hall was empty, and only Maria and Kazem-Bek with the generals remained standing.

Third, it would raise the prestige of the country as a whole!\n\nNot all troops were sent to the capital for the parade.

All of this would be accompanied by a military orchestra playing marches of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, which were still relevant. \n\nThe parade lasted about an hour and a half.

I will help you adapt to the whole process, but I will also make sure that your soul is not stale. You'll be a beautiful queen, I guarantee it," said Kazem-Bek, "You have nothing to worry about. You have impressed many of the electors with your frankness and kindness, which every Queen must have. Moreover, I'll tell you a secret, - Kazem-Bek took out a sheet of paper on which was a map of Western Russia. There were colored districts on it, - You won almost 70% of the electors in the elections, but we do not yet know how the "elite electors" will decide. But I am sure that you will win, and the dreams of the Russian people will turn into reality! After Kazem-Bek's words, Maria calmed down a bit and waited for the turmoil to end and the voting to begin. \n\nThe electors, who had been chosen by the people, voted first. The results were as follows: 68 votes for Maria Vladimirovna, 20 votes for Kosygin-Romanov, and 12 votes for Beloozersky. Beloozersky gave Maria a leering look when these results were announced, but his indignation was replaced with a smile. Soon the "elite electors," who were half military, began voting. Maria understood that after all, Beloozersky had gotten his way and put his people there. But she hoped that the other half, which consisted of officials, partisans, and businessmen, would vote for her. The results were as follows: 63 votes for Beloozersky, 24 votes for Maria Vladimirovna, and 13 remaining votes for Kosygin-Romanov. By simple mathematics, it could be calculated that Maria has 92 votes, Beloozersky has 75 votes, and Kosygin-Romanov has 33 votes. But Kosygin-Romanov immediately stood up: \n\nnIn view of this situation, I want to give all of my votes to one of these candidates! There was a frantic noise and rumbling around their heads. A lot of people (mostly military) started complaining that this was wrong. However, nowhere in the election law was there a clause prohibiting the transfer of votes to another candidate. Soon, people calmed down, sat down at their seats, and waited for Kosygin-Romanov's decision. Now Kosygin-Romanov had a huge responsibility: he would choose a new Tsar for the Russian people. He began his speech: "I give all my votes to Maria Vladimirovna! His decision was met with stormy applause from Maria's supporters and a negative reaction from Beloozersky's supporters. But there was nothing to be done about it - the lot was cast and now Maria Vladimirovna was the tsarina chosen by the people."

The main votes had been counted, but it was still necessary to find out how many voters would vote for specific candidates.\n\nThe waiting was quite painful and exhausting. The minutes seemed long, even though one could make their wait more lively with conversations and snacks. Interestingly, Kosygin-Romanov did not consume alcohol, only water and juices, which looked very unusual among the elites who loved to drink champagne. The comfortable chair at one moment of waiting began to seem not comfortable at all, and at the same time, one wanted to sleep, but it was impossible to do so because of the heavy anticipation.\n\nThere were only 200 votes, but it was necessary to find out who was voting for whom. Finally, it became known how many had voted for each candidate. This was announced at 22:00 local time.\n\nAt 22:15, after all the people had gathered in one hall, the following results were announced:\n\nAlexei Romanov - 103 votes - 51.5% of the votes.\n\nMaria Romanova - 53 votes - 26.5% of the votes.\n\nSergei Belozersky - 44 votes - 22% of the votes.\n\nAlexei Romanov was declared the winner.

Reminiscing about the notorious year of 1962, he realized how much had changed in his life and how he had achieved such unprecedented success. Not so long ago, he was repenting for his indirect collaboration with the Nazis who helped Vladimir III in the Western Russian War. What could Kazem-Bek have been thinking at that moment? Probably only that these past events had finally been left behind, and he was no longer followed by the shadow of a collaborator. The shameful stigma of a traitor to the Motherland and a murderer of Russian people was washed away by the righteous desire to unite Russia and virtuous deeds. We are no longer perceived as collaborators, we are now perceived as liberators of Russia and those who give hope for a bright future.\n\nEvery killed Russian person during the Battle for Western Russia was the price he paid for the unification of Russia. He was truly sorry that he had to shed Russian blood again, but this time he did it not for personal goals, but for Russia and the future sons of the Motherland. This is a small price for this noble goal. It can be said with certainty that there was no other way to do it, and if we had not sacrificed several hundred or thousand Russian people, even more blood would have been shed, of hundreds of thousands of people. Russia was lucky to have the right people in the right place.\n\nCan it be said that Kazem-Bek led the campaign to atone for his sins? Yes, it can be said. Did he redeem his sins? He created the Mladorossi state, which stood tall in all its giant growth and, like a phoenix from the legends, illuminated all of free Russia with its light. Our enemies did not understand and could not understand the full magnitude of this moment, they resisted us and they paid for it. Yes, it can be said that we were able to atone for our sins. And now, having cleansed ourselves of the sins of the past, we can move forward towards the Mladorossi dream.\n\nRussia is proud to move forward, towards new victories."

The general staff, together with Kazem-Bek, were discussing their actions towards the state of Bashkiria. One group of generals (Ardashev and Volkov) were considering supplying pro-Russian elements in Bashkiria with equipment, overthrowing the government of Akhmet-Zaki, and peacefully annexing it. Other generals (Vavilov and Volkov) believed that talk of peaceful annexation was complete nonsense and that they should simply launch a quick attack on Ufa. The discussion lasted for several hours and even led to insults being thrown around. And Kazem-Bek remained silent. Suspiciously silent. \n\nWhen the generals quieted down, Kazem-Bek stood up and began his musings:\n\n"After listening to all of you, I have a dual opinion on this interesting situation. Either we stage a coup, using the precious equipment that we sometimes don't even have in the army, or we don't worry about it and simply launch an invasion of Bashkiria, using our brave soldiers this time. I propose a compromise between your positions..." Kazem-Bek took out a well-organized letter from his jacket. "A letter of conscience. Soon, I will send it directly to Akhmet-Zaki Validi in Bashkiria. I will offer him the peaceful annexation of Bashkiria to Berezniki, as well as very good autonomy within New Russia, and amnesty to the entire government of Bashkiria. If they refuse, of course, it will be sad. However, we will not cry over it and will attack them. The entire government will be sent to prison, but I still intend to keep the autonomy of Bashkiria. What do you say, generals?"\n\nArdashev listened attentively to Kazem-Bek, and when Kazem-Bek finished his lengthy speech, he asked, "So we're sending them an ultimatum?"\n\n"Correct, Ardashev, correct," replied Kazem-Bek. The generals were silent. They all agreed.

The guard went to the office where the leader of the liberation movement of Bashkiria during the Russian Revolution and head of the Islamic republic, Ahmet-Zaki Validi, usually works. He is popular among the Bashkir people and is almost like the father of the nation. During the Front's collapse, he proudly led Bashkiria during its darkest days, repelled the bloody raids of the Aryan Brotherhood, who encroached on the magnificent expanses of Bashkiria. The guard (named Guzel) was pleased to protect and live at the same time as Ahmet-Zaki. \n\nSoon, Ahmet-Zaki personally entered the office. He was over 70 years old, but in his eyes, you could still see a fiery and passionate spark that had not frozen over time:\n\n- Yes, my dear Guzel? - Zaki replied with a smile. "I'm sorry I didn't answer right away. I was praying in the next room."\n\n- Are you apologizing for that? It's our sacred obligation! But that's not the point now. You have a letter. An important letter," Guzel put the letter on Zaki's desk, bowed, and left. \n\n- Interesting, what could they write to me so important? \n\nZaki put on his old glasses, opened the letter, and began to read: "Greetings, President of the Islamic Republic of Bashkortostan, Ahmet-Zaki Valid Togan! Today I announce a profitable proposal for you and for the Bashkir people. We offer you to voluntarily join Bereznyaky on the terms of great autonomy, where you will have your parliament, your elections, your constitution, your faith within our great country. Our peoples are bound by a long history of friendship and harmony, and together we will become even stronger! However, if you refuse this noble proposal, our troops will take Ufa by storm, and blood will be shed. I hope you don't want the Bashkirs to fall for nothing. The people of Bashkiria rely on your conscience and wisdom. \n\nKazem-Bek, leader of Bereznyaky \n\nZaki took off his glasses with shaking hands after reading. He faced a choice. An important choice for Bashkiria. Either surrender or fight. And if he really loses the battle, what then? Blood will be shed on the sacred Bashkir land. He did not want this. But what if the autonomy that Kazem-Bek spoke of was just a lie? He faced a difficult choice...

As usual, there were two options: an ultimatum or a regular invasion. However, one of the generals, namely Ardachev, came up with a pretty good third option:\n\n- Comrades generals and Alexander Lvovich! I suggest a simple plan to you all, but it is also a brilliant one! The thing is, in 1963, the Democrats in the Komi Republic stood their ground, and their democracy has finally been strengthened. So, we need to take advantage of pro-Russian sentiments! Let's ask the Komi government to hold a referendum on joining Berezniki. After all, people in Komi know how we have already taken the south of Central Russia and see us as the unifiers of Russia. Therefore, if they refuse to hold a referendum, the republic will explode! Of course, they don't want that, so the referendum will be held. And then, as God sends, we will either win or lose, and that's when we can invade this country. But to be honest, - Ardachev raised his gaze slightly. - The chances of us losing are incredibly small. Checkmate, - Ardachev proudly finished his speech.\n\nThe generals began to consult with each other, as his plan was good, but there were still some issues. The Komi Republic has been in existence for about 10 years, which is enough time for "separatism" to arise. They will call themselves not Russians, but Komi, so they will reduce the chances of winning this referendum. And what are the chances that the leaders of this republic will simply refuse to acknowledge the results of the elections? There will be a regular invasion. Therefore, they considered this plan unnecessary. However, there were those who supported Ardachev without hesitation:\n\n- A good plan, Ardachev, which will allow us to annex them without bloodshed! - Vavilov said inspiringly.\n\nBut the floor was given to Kazem-Bek. Rising from his chair, he began to approach Ardachev:\n\n- Well, Ardachev, I'm impressed. This plan is truly brilliant.

The escape failed.\n\nThe soldiers forced Gutrum out of the car and sent him to the first prison in Permheim. It was much easier with Wagner's supporters - they either surrendered to the forces of Bereznikov or didn't even try to run. When he and his associates were imprisoned, Bereznikov's intelligence agency was ordered to start searching for all documents that could indicate a crime against the Russian people. But Gutrum had already given orders to destroy any documentation in his administration, and although he didn't manage to destroy everything, much was lost, probably forever. Many facts of crimes were already hidden from our sight.\n\nHowever, even what we uncovered was enough to hand down a death sentence. In addition, this is confirmed by the testimony of several thousand slaves and some associates who believe that if they tell everything, they will be forgiven.\n\nAfter a very short period of time, the trial of Wagner and his associates began. Everything was done as demonstratively as possible, even film and cameras were used to capture all the moments of the trial. And, ironically, the trial was decided to be held in Permheim.

All this time, evidence and accusations against the leader of the Aryan gang were being read out. And even though he denied everything, all the people who were still on his side not long ago were against him.\n\nAs soon as the charges and evidence against Gutrum were finished, he seemed to have resigned himself to his fate and his eyes became empty, his gaze bewildered. In the end, the court gave the final verdict: the highest punishment - execution.\n\n12 hours after the trial, in the middle of the night, the verdict was announced and 5 members of the firing squad were sent to Gutrum. Wagner, in the last second before his death, managed to shout, "Heil Gutrum!" The shot was fired... He fell dead.\n\nThe same was done with all the other accomplices, but without pompous phrasing, and someone at least tried to repent, but Themis, the goddess of justice, is uncompromising. And they all suffered retribution for all their crimes."

 MAR_smuta_occupation.2.d:0 "Kazem-Bek was driving in his car from Bereznikov to Vladimir III's personal residence, located near Vyatka. He was alone, except for his driver, who knew how to get to the residence. While driving in his car, Kazem-Bek remembered how he had joined forces with Vladimir III and how well they knew each other. They had become friends in the struggle for Western Russia... It was very sad, but those were the conditions. If Kazem-Bek had delayed his attack on Vyatka, the czar himself might have tried to destroy him.\n\nAfter several hours of a difficult journey, he arrived at the residence. The residence itself was not damaged during the fighting, as few people could even reach it. Nevertheless, there was no security here. And overall, there was no one here, as Vladimir had been placed under house arrest on Kazem-Bek's orders.\n\nOccupying this residence, he ordered to bring Vladimir III to this residence, who is now relatively close by. After a day, Vladimir III finally arrived and got out of the car and headed to the residence.\n\nExchanging greetings and asking how they were doing, Kazem-Bek suggested they go to the second floor and continue the conversation there. Upon reaching the second floor, you could see portraits of some of the Romanovs - Alexander III, Nicholas II, and others.\n\n"Vladimir, I want to say that we have certain plans for your daughter, Maria Romanovna," said Kazem-Bek.\n\n"What plans? Nothing bad will happen to her?" Vladimir asked cautiously.\n\n"We want to make her the ruler of the new Russian state. It turns out that I myself will not be able to rule for long due to political circumstances, and after all this mess in Western Russia is over, I want to nominate her as a candidate for the Russian throne."\n\n"As a candidate?" Vladimir III asked. "So it's possible that she won't become the ruler?"\n\n"Exactly, because after the end of the turmoil, there will be the Zemsky Sobor, which will elect one of two candidates, including your daughter. If the Sobor votes for her, she will become the queen," said Kazem-Bek. "If she becomes the queen, until she becomes an adult and independent, I will be her regent."\n\n"And if she's not elected?" Vladimir asked.\n\n"Your daughter will be sent to you as a father for further education. We will not do anything else with her, just like with you," Kazem-Bek said.\n\n"What is my fate?" Vladimir III said.\n\n"I suggest you give up political activity. I can return your servants, your residence, and leave your noble title, but in return, you take an oath not to engage in politics. I will keep my word that you will not be touched after you promise not to participate in the country's life."\n\n"It's sad that it turned out this way, but I'm glad you're giving me the opportunity to at least keep this in my old age. I will sincerely believe that you will lead Russia further to prosperity," Vladimir said with sadness, but with an understanding that his political activity was over from now on.\n\nAfter this conversation, Kazem-Bek returned to Bereznikov to continue his political affairs, while Vladimir began his new, more peaceful life."

 MAR_smuta_occupation.3.d:0 "After the war, there are many generals imprisoned who were on the side of Vladimir III. Many of these generals were ideological supporters of Viatka, serving their king since the time of the West Russian War, and they definitely bear the stigma of collaborationists. Despite the fact that they were enemies of the Russian people, having sided with the Germans, they were nevertheless good military specialists who put up worthy resistance to our troops during the fighting. This suggests that their leadership talents are still noticeable.\n\nWe could have judged them the same way as in Perm and executed them all by firing squad. However, Kazem-Bek believes that these people could still be useful to the Motherland. The army of Bereznikov is quite scarce in senior officers purely due to the population factor, and to ease the situation, we could recruit several such generals into our service.\n\nBelozersky instructed his subordinates to convey the proposal to the generals to take the military oath to Berezniki and the Party of Mladorossi and begin military service in exchange for their freedom from prison. Such a proposal was sent to all the generals, but almost all of them refused to give the oath to Kazem-Bek himself. Many of them say that Mladorossi are traitors to the Russian monarchy. In their opinion, when we were still on the same side against the Revolutionary Front, we were still fighting for the right, white cause and the cause of the king, but what we just did can only be interpreted as betrayal. Some of them considered us their friends, but some generals took this betrayal very bitterly and have strong dislike. Some still believe that the struggle is not over and the Tsar will return. As for collaboration with the Germans, they believe that you can fight against the red plague even with them, as long as it is not for the Reds.\n\nClearly, it is dangerous to release such generals even on parole, let alone take them into service. But among all the ideological composition, there are two people who still agreed to take the oath to the ideas of Mladorossi. Evgeny Eduardovich Messner, an ideological anti-communist, agreed to take the oath under the pretext of fighting the communists. He believes that this is definitely better than rotting in prison and seeing how the Motherland is divided into communist and royal. He found enough common ground in our ideas, though he has big questions about our ideology. The second person, Zagaynov Georgiy Prokopyevich, fully and almost without words agreed to take the oath to Kazem-Bek and the people of Bereznikov.\n\nA week later, they solemnly took their oath, changed the color of their uniform, and joined the service of Mladorossi Russia. And although some people raise serious concerns about the loyalty of the new regime, we must follow the principle of "trust, but verify" with them. We will put our special services to monitor them and look for all information about their activities. Therefore, their lives will depend on what they will do behind our backs."

One could blame Kazem-Bek, as he was the initiator, but history is written by the victors. And now in Berezniki they will be judging the perpetrator of this unclear war - Abdulla Alishev. \n\nKazem-Bek personally attended the trial. On the first row next to him were the generals, and on all the others - the judges. Across from them was Abdulla Alishev, who was almost in chains. He had noticeably lost weight, and looked worn out and weak. Kazem-Bek felt his triumph over him. They only had to wait for the judges' decision. \n\n"Abdulla Alishev, you are sentenced to death for your collaboration, for your actions that led to the war between Berezniki and Tatarstan. It was YOU who caused the deaths of both Russian and Tatar people! Can you still be called a 'hero of Tatarstan'? You are given your last word before execution." \n\nAbdulla Alishev lifted his head to his judges and personally looked Kazem-Bek in the eye:\n\n"Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, you are blind, you are too blind. I was defending Tatarstan from your ambitions. I was defending Tatarstan from the occupation regime. I only wanted a peaceful sky over this sacred land! But you can never understand. Yet you yourself were born in Kazan, and now your troops are plundering our holy city! Do you think that with my death the Tatars will calm down? They know the truth, the truth that you want to hide from others. Remember my words!"\n\nKazem-Bek watched him through his whole speech, then quietly whispered in the ear of one of the generals:\n\n"Finish the process quickly, I feel sick..." \n\nAfter a short and hot speech, Abdulla was led outside to the wall. Vavilov was pleased to throw him against it:\n\n"Soldiers! Prepare!"\n\nThe soldiers prepared their rifles and aimed at the man who no longer cared. Shots rang out.

So, quickly regrouping, they headed to the first warehouse.\n\nThe first warehouse was located to the south of the city of Gorky, about 10 kilometers from the city, near the village of Kalachevo. The villagers themselves did not suspect that a strategically important object was located right under their nose in the forest.

Soon a metallic sparkle appeared. It was still a warehouse.\n\nAlexey ordered to find a way in and examine the contents of the warehouse. They found the passage, but it was locked... they had to use dynamite, but in such a way that the contents of the warehouse would not be damaged. There was a little overdue dynamite that was laid near the entrance:\n\n- Get down! - Alexey shouted to his soldiers who were hiding near the trees, and boom!

Everything was wonderful: tall forests, sunbeams lighting his way, and only five or six kilometers left to the border. However, a surprise was waiting for him.\n\nA checkpoint with a large number of soldiers was set up at the border. There were probably at least ten people there. There was no queue, so Nikita tried to drive through as if nothing was happening, but he was stopped:\n\n"Comrade! You need to go through inspection before crossing the border!" Nikita realized he was screwed. If they found out about the "goods," they would force him to talk about the boss. He had to find a way out:\n\n"Ummm, sorry, I'd rather leave..."

First, he began to talk about his life and about Eurasianism in a very negative way. Many thought that the judge would soon turn to insults, but this did not happen. At most, he called Gumilev "insane". Next up was Shafarevich. They also began to describe his life, his scientific activities, and then got to his political activities.

For your political activity, for your complicity with Gumilev's clique, you are sentenced to 20 years in prison.

I was put here with one single, but big goal, namely to turn you into real soldiers. There's a war coming where you have to die for our country and proudly carry the banner of Mladarossi! And now, fall in!' \n\nIt was after these words that we began to really train. Naturally, the young soldiers didn't like it, but at least Kirill was happy that they were doing something. Kirill was at war. In a terrible war. He also saw its consequences. \n\n'Hey, soldier!' they woke him up from his thoughts, 'Why are we sleeping during training? Clean the rifles! They got so dirty while you were here walking around and drinking our great army away!' Unexpectedly, they threw the Mosin rifle at Kirill, and he dropped it. The colonel snorted, and Kirill stared blankly at the Mosin rifle. Taking a rag and disassembling the rifle itself, Kirill got down to business. During the shot, various combustion products, capsule composition, and traces from the passage get into the barrel..."

We miss out on the beauty that surrounds us: swollen buds, the song of the nightingale, small flowers, green grass.\n\nThat's what Uncle Maxim thought. Maxim was born here, in Perm, but the war forced him and his family to move to the USA. There, his work as a doctor became famous all over the world. Many celebrities came to see him from all over the world, and he treated everyone, even Germans who had misbehaved in his homeland. But as sweet as his life abroad was, his heart longed for his homeland. For its vast fields and dense forests. And that's why he decided to return to Perm. But because of certain circumstances (the Aryan Brotherhood), Maxim decided to settle slightly north of Perm, in Berezniki. There, he wanted to build a grand house for his entire family, as well as work for the Russian people who suffered much more than foreigners. And so he hired workers to start building the house 10 km south of Berezniki, near the forest.\n\nBut for his idea of building a house, Maxim was called crazy. Their statement could be described as follows:\n\n“Our neighbor is an ignoramus, he's crazy,\nHe's a pharmazon, he drinks only\nOne glass of red wine,\nHe doesn't approach ladies,\nEverything is yes yes no, he won't say yes or no”.

Nonetheless, it had been more than a dozen years since Gainy had electricity, and for children who had never seen light bulbs or street lamps before, electrification seemed nothing short of a miracle from God. In just two weeks, the number of street lamps in Gainy tripled, and in many houses, brand new incandescent bulbs replaced oil lamps.\n\nJust a month ago, Anna wouldn't have even thought of letting her son out of the house after sunset, and Valerka himself was afraid of the dark and wouldn't have agreed to go anywhere. However, now there is light on the streets, and even the arduous trek to the other side of town, to the well, doesn't seem so difficult.\n\nAs soon as the boy stepped out of the house, he saw a crowd of people across the street. They had surrounded something. Valerka slipped between the gawkers and finally saw what they were all looking at. A strange G-shaped metal thing protruded straight out of the ground. Suddenly, a woman approached. She placed a bucket under the device and pressed the "nose" of the machine. To Valerka's surprise, water poured into the bucket.\n\n"Imagine that! It's a water column.

Sergey tempered his ardor, reminding himself that he was only second to God from now on, and should always express his will everywhere.\n\nSergey looked down at the altar.

This last plane was supposed to carry gold, awarded by the government of Yemen in gratitude for the assistance in the fight against the rebels. \n\nThe last Russian soldiers, rolling up their sleeves and baring their hands, and having a small patina, were loading the gold slowly. This gold will benefit our country and our people, but it will not compensate for all the losses of Russians in this war that was unnecessary for our people so far from the homeland. However, it was the order of the Tsar himself to fight on the other side of the world. \n\nAfter some time, when the gold was almost loaded, a car with a certain man approached the plane, who had a box wrapped in black velvet. \n\nThe translator who was with the soldiers began to translate what this parliamentarian was saying to the Russians: \n\n- He says that this is a personal gift from our Sultan to your Tsar Sergei Belozersky. This is a golden sword of one of the companions of Muhammad. \n\nTell them that Russian volunteers accept this gift! \n\nAfter that, the soldiers fully loaded onto this plane, and it flew north, back to the homeland."

Soon the car pulled up at the former residence of the Italian governor, where flags of the Muslim Brotherhood were already waving. Inside, the head of the Brotherhood, Sayyid Qutb, was waiting for him. \n\nAt first, Demichev was wary of this man, but after armed men left the room, the conversation turned to a more peaceful phase. Sayyid thanked Russia for its support of the Muslim Brotherhood, although he understood that Russians were helping the Brotherhood only because the other sides were even worse for Russia. \n\nHowever, this did not cool the relationship between the two countries, and a few hours later, they agreed that trade agreements would be concluded between the new Egypt and Russia, which would help both countries."

As it is, his fellow compatriots have done a great job at setting up the place, preparing a welcome most worthy of those that have helped their noble struggle to statehood and even reverse the roles of oppression-the Russians. As he eyes the watch on his wrist, a radio from air control notifies him of the arriving delegate: the small plane can be seen on the horizon, it's shadows contrasting the rising sun on the background as it's landing gear slowly retracts, landing the plane smoothly on the runway. What followed happened just as planned; the stairway is quickly pulled to the plane's doorway as it stops before the carpetry, with the Russian delegates soon going down the stairs to the cheers of the stationed crowds. As both sides soon stand on solid ground saluting to their anthems respectfully, Dilwa carefully analyses the stoic expression of the Russian delegates, trying to decipher their thoughts, intentions, or feelings that may influence the negotiations forwardto little avail-before resuming his duties afterwards, guiding the two men into the waiting motorcade while he occupies his thoughts with curiosity, apologizing that his superiors cannot arrive due to the busyness of running their newly-aquired extensive territory. The motorcade would go onward, and Dilwa would be left with the task of cleaning the premises, hoping the best of the negotiations to come.\n\nIt has been but a few days since, yet it feels so long for the government employee at the ministry of foreign affairs, him having placed a personal interest ever since. Taking in any bit of information he can between his work, Dilwa now rests easy in his home and, starting his short holiday as reads through the resolution on a newspaper he had brought just that day.

A cradle of civilization by it's own right, the walls of the city has overseen the lives of men countless; their lives, deaths, and aspirations collectively leaving a mark on the city, a city which is due to see some more in such days of strife, yet to be over irregardless.\n\nBaghdad has been a spot of vying and legitimacy for each of the Iraqi splinter states in their disastorous civil war, seeing the city as a vital key of legitimacy. To this, each side has invested massively to either the capture of defense of the city, with minefields, military caches, agitators, propagandists, and agents. The first two is but a problem of skill, but the latter three still possess a threat as large as it is to any other side of the civil war, speading disinformation, wrecking terror attacks, and threatening the stability of state in the occupation of Iraq as a whole. Deeming the threat to be too much of a risk, action has finally be authorized under the famed "Jackal of Iraq", Vladimir Zhirinovsky.\n\n"Change of plans-groups [one] and [five] sweep downtown, while Groups [three] and [eight] go through the main entrance. Group [six] and [ten] will follow me-the rest, stay to the planned routes. Remember, they're due to die anyways."\n\nTo admit, Zhirinovsky finds himself tired to have speak at greater volumes through the microphone, not helped by the turning rotors on his chopper that simply outscreams him everytime. Recieving confirmation however, the man gave a satisfied exhale as the chopper slowly approached on their drop-zone, noticing other helicopters straying away to help "clean" other parts of the city-they are far away from base now, certainly.\n\nAs the chopper slowly settle on the sanded cushions below, Zhirinovsky and his groups stepped down, rifles held tight in hand. Their first target of the day would be a Ba'athist agitator, having been spotted and confirmed in location by Tsarist spies a few days ago, his face made sure to have been noted by all the men as they approach their target. Soon deemed clear for entry, Zhirinovsky led his men in, sweeping the lower floor to no avail, before going upstairs to encounter a man laying helplessly behind an open windowsill, his legs certainly having betrayed him in fear. Despite his claims of ignorance, his face matched the records, and he is soon put out of his misery.\n\nHe sighed for the second time of the day. The others won't be so easy, and certainly he will lose a fair share of men from his side too. Hearing gunshots ring out through the horizon, he quickly ordered his groups to continue on move; their presence would've been noticed now, and they still have a number of names to check out."

Yet, even within such a bussiness one place stands out more than another, a place now swarmed with all manners of reporters, while protected from all sides by the best bodyguards the nation and money could offer; a place that will nominally be a simple highclass hotel, now the landmark where the fate of Iraq will be charted, a place of civilized negotiation whose values and goals will be uphold in history books throughout all time.\n\nOne by one the players of history appear; Saddam Hussein, the hero of millions, arrives first in his protected limousine. Giving an inspiring speech, the man called for peace and unity not only in Iraq, but through the middle east and the world aswell. "The times of war are behind us, and we must do all we can to not let it stand before us again", he said, to the cheers of crowds and acclaim of observers, giving respect to the crowd before going into the hotel. Next would come notable yet overall faceless people; regional delegates, heads of government, opposing ideologues, and Russian mediators, all of them passing short remarks and giving respects, but none striking as deep as Hussein's.\n\nAnd so it begins, the negotiations. While many would speculate on it's results, no definite information can be verifiably confirmed to have leaked out of the hotel. Some claimed the negotiations fell through, others claim it was salvageable, and yet, when the time finally came, the Mosul Declaration absolutely stunned all, silencing both supporters and oppositions to such a joyous event unfolding; atlast, after so long, people's lifelihoods will be restored, families reunited, and an entire nation under a banner of healing together. The sun seems to shine brighter, and the world seems to stand still in joy, even if only for awhile. Perhaps all those lost lifes will amount to something, afterall."

He overcame poverty, defeated his father's regressive ideas, and began his life as a lowly clerk in the capital, holding the position of assistant to the next Italian bootlicker. This did not suit him, but this meager income helped him to adapt to the rapidly changing world. Then he began writing books, reading Western humanists, and his name spread throughout his homeland. \n\nAnd then the war came, but Saddam saw it as an opportunity rather than a catastrophe. He left Baghdad, crossed the front line, and fled to the Kurds, where he quickly became the leading voice of the local radio station, boosting the morale of his comrades and fueling anti-government and anti-Baathist movements in the enemy's ranks. His voice became the hope of millions. After the war, it became clear who would win the first elections and which politician the Russian benefactors of free Iraq had bet on."

 MAR_forpol.1.d:0 "For centuries, the people of Iran have lived at the crossroads of civilizations. Being located between India and the Middle East, locals have always faced huge risks but could also benefit from this position. In the post-war years, the Persian Shah pursued closer ties with the Third Reich. However, not all the people of Iran were willing to accept this, and at that time, the Shah's government could afford to suppress the voices of dissenters.\n\nBut now the Shah is dead, and the country is rapidly descending into chaos. Meanwhile, Americans, Japanese, and Germans are trying to profit from the death and suffering of ordinary Iranians. Russia cannot remain on the sidelines while there is a confrontation nearby; we must intervene and put an end to the civil war."

As states from Egypt to Persia plunge into chaos, people all over the world are beginning to feel the consequences of the oil crisis. Economies are collapsing, businesses are closing, and dissatisfied masses are taking to the streets. At the same time, superpowers are playing their games in the Middle East, trying to take advantage of panic and gain allies on the lands of the former Silk Road.

At the same time, this is an opportunity for Russia to gain allies on the Black Continent. Let's go! It's time to show the full power of Russia!"

Now, after the shah's death and with no one to hold power, his empire collapsed like a house of cards. As a result, a civil war broke out in Iran, with the forces of the united opposition fighting against the remnants of the shah's loyalists, who are supported by Germany. Our best course of action is to support the reformist monarchist forces led by Shapur Bakhtiar, who want to keep the shah in power but reform the country into a constitutional monarchy.

His job was to ensure the safety of all embassy members, which was of enormous importance, as he was protecting people who had to build relationships between two states.\n\nEntering his office located in the embassy, Ruslan took off his hat, poured himself some tea, and sat in a large black armchair when suddenly the phone rang. Belyakov picked up the receiver. \n\n"Ruslan Yakovlevich, the Prime Minister Alexander Kazem-Bek would like to speak with you."\n\n"I'm ready.

But when the army suffered defeat, he fled to Bereznyaky. Now Alexander was sent to Iran as a volunteer, where he seemed to have returned to those times when he fought in a partisan detachment, only this time there were mountains that helped Shevchenko's detachment to hide from the enemy. However, the Shahdom suffered defeat, and evacuation was announced. But Alexander did not want to leave these lands and reported this to his unit commander, Roman Fyodorovich Kapustin.\n\nEntering the headquarters, he saw the commander smoking a cigarette and reading the latest issue of Young Russia. Alexander saluted, and the commander invited him to sit down at the table.\n\n"Well, Alexander Mikhailovich. What did you want from me?"\n\n"Roman Fyodorovich. I came to you with a request. I would like to stay in these lands to continue the war against the enemy."\n\n"Roman Kapustin almost choked on the smoke from his cigarette at his words.\n\n"Alexander Mikhailovich, what are you talking about? We were ordered to leave the region. We lost."\n\n"Yes. For ordinary soldiers, the battle is lost. But for me, as a man of the old school, it continues. Understand, Roman Fyodorovich. I remember those times when Russia was united, and power was in the hands of the Romanov dynasty. I fought as a 19-year-old boy in the First World War. I fought in the Red Army during the Civil War, I was a partisan during the "Suvorov" operation. For me, life is an endless war."\n\n"Yes, I know about your service record.

I will give you supplies for the first time. I heard that remnants of the Shah's army are gathering in sabotage squads. Maybe they will take you there."\n\n"Okay. I will leave at dawn. I order you to declare me missing. Nobody is waiting for me anyway."\n\n"You know, people like you are impossible to forget.

 MAR_forpol.2.t: "New Position"
 MAR_forpol.2.d: "Yaroslav Gavrilov sat in the headquarters smoking and reading a newspaper about the complete surrender of all enemy forces to the power of the communists. Yaroslav Alexandrovich was previously an unremarkable KGB officer who was involved in fighting against criminals. However, during his service, he managed to rise to the rank of colonel, and he was ordered to coordinate the capture of the former Iranian capital - Tehran, and subsequently organize the search for remnants of counter-revolutionary elements in the city. And he did it excellently, for which he received the 2nd degree George Cross. Now he was waiting for orders from his superiors for further actions when suddenly his old colleague from work, the chief of the first person protection of the SFU KGB, Major General Grigory Viktorovich Alekseev, entered the headquarters. Yaroslav put out his cigarette, saluted, and invited his colleague to sit at the table.\n\n"Well, where am I being sent now, Grigory Viktorovich?"\n\n"Well, Yaroslav Alexandrovich, I have reviewed the results of your work in Tehran, and they are satisfied with it even in Tabriz. The leadership even ordered to award you with the Order of the Red Banner of the Socialist Federation of Iran for special merits.\n\n"I'm glad to hear that. But what about my future?\n\n"So, here's the thing. Our country's leadership considers it important to establish warm relations with the new government of the friendly people. Therefore, by decision of the commander of our troops in Iran, you are appointed responsible for ensuring the security of the new state. Your powers will consist of commanding battalions of internal security, which will search for and arrest the enemies of the new regime in the face of Islamists, democrats, and the like.\n\n"So, you want to make me the chief of police in Iran?\n\n"You could say that. Just remember that you have already been approved for this position. Refusal is not accepted.\n\n"From what date will I officially take it?\n\n"I just received a copy of this order. You can see it yourself.\n\n"Alekseev took a copy of the document from the inner pocket of his coat and told Gavrilov to familiarize himself with it, after which Yaroslav asked Alekseev a question.\n\n"And how long will I stay here, Grigory Viktorovich?\n\n"I don't know yet. But I think no more than two or three months.\n\n"Why exactly that long?\n\n"You know that my subordinates are responsible for the security of Eskandari? As far as I know, he will soon announce the new composition of the government. But right now he would like to use special people from the KGB, like you, as those who will establish preliminary order in the country. I believe you will return home when the government of the SFU is announced. I hope to see you soon, good luck in your new job."\n\nAfter that, Alekseev left the headquarters, and Gavrilov, after re-reading the order, put it on the table and continued reading the newspaper."

 MAR_forpol.3.t: "Failures and Victories"
 MAR_forpol.3.d: "Major of KGB Aleksey Vladimirovich Volkov, while staying in the capital, felt a sense of grief and sorrow. He remembered how he, as a commanding officer of a KGB battalion in Tabriz, received an order to withdraw all troops from the Socialist Federal Republic of Iran due to the ineffectiveness of the military contingent in conducting military operations. He remembered how at the beginning of the war, he hoped for the victory of revolutionary forces in Iran. But these dreams collapsed when the command decided to withdraw. He hoped for victory in this war, but it did not happen. He, like many war veterans, asked the only question: "Why did we even intervene in this war? What did we spill blood for the interests that never materialized?" His thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the front door. Opening it, he saw a man in a gray coat, hat, and glasses with large lenses called tishaydas. It was Major General of KGB Grigory Viktorovich Alekseev. Previously, he served in Iran and held the position of head of the security for the top officials of the Socialist Federal Republic of Iran. Aleksey rarely interacted with him before, but when they did, they acted as good colleagues and comrades-in-arms. \n\n- Grigory Viktorovich. What brings you to me? \n\n- Just wanted to visit an old colleague. And wanted to talk to you. \n\n- Well, if you came, then please come in. \n\nVolkov escorted the guest to the kitchen, poured tea for him and himself, and started a dialogue. \n\n- So what do you want to talk about with me, Grigory Viktorovich? Did you want to have a chat? \n\n- You could say that. \n\n- I'm now outraged by the withdrawal of troops from Iran. After all, we were not prepared for military operations in another country's territory. \n\n- Yes. I don't understand it myself. But it seems to me that the leadership can know better than us what is happening and what is the best course of action in this situation. \n\n- But the point here is different. This will show the world that our army suffered a defeat. We could not defeat the enemy. \n\n- You know, Aleksey, I served in both the Soviet Army under Bukharin and in the army of the Western Russian Revolutionary Front, and participated in the "Suvorov" operation. I worked on the destruction of the counter-revolutionaries. And over all these years, I realized one thing: everyone, sooner or later, will learn what defeat is and experience this unpleasant feeling. There are no invincible ones. \n\n- Are you saying that this defeat is just nothing? \n\n- If you look at it from a political point of view, then yes. Sometimes you can retreat, but at the same time, forget about returning to the lost territories. \n\nThey talked on various topics until evening. And when they said goodbye, Aleksey Volkov, sitting in the kitchen, thought about Alekseev's words and came to the conclusion that there was no point in experiencing a feeling of grief for a long time about the defeat, because on their way, they would encounter many more enemies. And when Alekseev left, Volkov, sitting on the balcony, said to himself."
