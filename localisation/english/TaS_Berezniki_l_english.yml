 MAR_THENEWORDER_DESC: "Being merely a remote eastern governorate of Vyatka Tsar Vladimir III, Berezniki, led by his viceroy Alexander Kazem-Bek, is a highly distinctive region not only in Western but possibly all of free Russia. Striving to combine the best of the Tsarist and Soviet regimes, Kazem-Bek's ideology developed the Mladorossy idea, harmoniously blending both systems. Many have heard of 'Mladorossysm,' but all tend to think Berezniki is a dark horse of free Russia with its mad ideas to merge two incompatible ideologies.\n\nKazem-Bek and his people are subordinate to Vladimir III, and even finding common ground on some issues, it is clear this status quo will not hold. Alexander has his own vision for Russia's future, conflicting with Tsar Vladimir's. Perhaps it's time to reconsider their hidden potential?"

 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.1: "History of the Movement"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.1: "Not even a thousand words could describe the pain Russia has endured since Emperor Nicholas II abdicated. It seemed the entire country went mad in an instant. Famine, terror, wars. It’s no wonder monarchist ideas resonated among those who remembered the calm times before the abdication. Among White émigrés, countless monarchist parties formed. Without a doubt, the most extravagant émigré party was the §RMladorossy Party§! of §YAlexander Kazem-Bek§!.\n\n§RThe Mladorossy Party§! ceased to exist in 1942. After the party dissolved, §YAlexander Kazem-Bek§! participated in countless organizations. But in moments of the people's greatest sorrow, his soul inevitably yearned for the §WMotherland§!."
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.2: "Kazem-Bek's History"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.2: "§RThe West Russian War§!—the Communists' desperate attempt at revenge—ended in catastrophe. The collapse of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! led to countless cliques, juntas, and directorates. One such entity was the §GVyatka Principality§!. §WVladimir Romanov§!, ruling this state, couldn’t control his domain alone, so he separated the §YTrans-Kama Governorate§! from §GVyatka§!. §YAlexander Kazem-Bek§!, partly due to his intellect, partly due his authority among émigrés, and often through luck or connections with the §BCIA§!, effectively seized power in the governorate by 1958. Since then, he methodically purged Vladimir’s loyalists while reviving the long-forgotten ideas of the §RMladorossy§!."
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.3: "Relations with Vyatka"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.3: "De jure, §YBerezniki§! still answers to §GVyatka§!, but Vladimir’s influence here is nearly zero. Only a fool would think §WVladimir§! is unaware of events in this distant governorate. However, the Tsar has plenty of issues in his own domain. Though §GVyatka§! attempts to meddle in the governorate’s politics, his agents rarely act proactively, merely unnerving Berezniki’s counterintelligence. Thus, §RKazem-Bek§! can rest easy knowing the §nOkhranka§! agents won’t come for his soul anytime soon.\n\nOnly God knows when a rift will emerge between the Tsar and his willful governor. Yet almost no one doubts it will happen eventually, risking both their lives and hundreds of their subordinates."

 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.4: "Gil's History"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.4: "§rVladimir Gil§! is one of the few leaders in §YBerezniki§! who fought in both wars against the Germans. Yet his combat path can hardly be called heroic or valiant. Captured in the first month of the war, by autumn 1941 he began collaborating with the Germans. In 1942, §rGil§! led the punitive §bsquad 'Druzhina'§!, which grew into a brigade. The brigade conducted punitive actions against partisans in Vitebsk.\n\nTheir efficiency made partisans across Belarus fear §rGil§!. This same efficiency allowed him to remain in the §bSS§! ranks after Operation Barbarossa ended.\n\nAmid the chaos of the §RWest Russian War§! and the SS army mutiny, §rGil§! switched to the §RWRRF§! side. When §GOperation 'Suvorov'§! failed, §rGil§! and a small group of §RWRRF§! officers took refuge in the §YTrans-Kama Governorate§!, where they met 1962."
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.5: "Belozersky's History"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.5: "§CSergei Beloselsky-Belozersky§!, often simply called §CBelozersky§!, was a White Guard émigré who returned to Vyatka after §WVladimir III§!'s appeal. Before the §RWest Russian War§! ended, §CBelozersky§! served in France, Britain, and even the American §BUSS and CIA.§! There, he befriended Alexander Kazem-Bek. Fate bound them for years. When §CBelozersky§! was sent to France, §RKazem-Bek§! followed. They joined §WVladimir III§!'s émigré organization together. Following §RKazem-Bek§!, §CBelozersky§! went to the §YTrans-Kama Governorate§!, becoming a loyal ally and pillar for his comrade. Will their cooperation last, or will their paths diverge? Only time will tell."
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content.6: "Kosygin's History"
 MAR_CountryInfo_Content_desc.6: "§eAlexei Kosygin§!, amidst a sea of collaborators and White Guards, stands out like a red apple in a potato pile. He succeeded under §RSoviet rule§! even before the war. During the war, he chaired the Evacuation Council. Unlike many chairmen, he focused not on saving his skin but on his mission. He worked selflessly, evacuating industries beyond the Urals, ironically refusing to evacuate himself until the front neared Moscow. §eKosygin§! then went to §GRykov§!. His work allowed the §RWRRF§! to accumulate enough materiel for Operation 'Suvorov'. Yet when the front collapsed, generals and commissars scapegoated him. Persecuted, Kosygin found refuge in §YBerezniki§!."

 TaS_leader_name_Alexandr_Kazembek: "Alexander Kazem-Bek"
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KAZEMBEK_DESC: "Born into a family of a retired guardsman and leader of the nobility in Spassky Uyezd, Kazan Governorate, Lev Alexandrovich Kazem-Bek. Due to his father’s postings, the future Mladorossy leader traveled widely across Russia and Western Europe. He graduated from Tsarskoye Selo Nicholas II Real School and joined the scouting movement, earning the rank of Scoutmaster by May 1917. In November 1919, in Rostov, Alexander enlisted in the White Army’s Uhlan Regiment, commanding a squadron of 40, mostly captured Red Army soldiers. Falling ill, he fled to Constantinople with his parents on January 17, 1920, eventually reaching Belgrade.\n\nIn 1923, in Munich, Kazem-Bek founded the 'Young Russia' youth union, evolving into the Mladorossy movement by 1925 in Paris. Initially sympathetic to Hitler and Mussolini, he backed Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich as Tsar. After Kirill’s death, Kazem-Bek clashed with his son Vladimir Kirillovich. Post-1937, he shifted leftward, realizing German and Italian policies threatened the USSR.\n\nDuring WWII, Kazem-Bek was arrested in France but released, moving to the US. After Germany attacked the USSR, he dissolved his party to let members serve the Motherland. Post-war, he worked in the US, collaborating with intelligence. During the West Russian War, he joined Project 'Solntse' to infiltrate Vladimir III’s collaborators. Bringing old comrades and Sergei Belozersky, Kazem-Bek gained Vladimir III’s trust, becoming Trans-Kama Governor. Now, he awaits the right moment to overthrow Vladimir and forge a new Russia."

 POLITICS_MIKLAY_KAZAKOV_DESC: "The Mari people long lacked statehood under any Russian regime. Nikolai Ivanovich Kazakov dedicated his life to change this. As the Anti-Communist Guard’s victory in West Russia became inevitable, he rallied ethnic Mari to form the Mari Regiment, fighting alongside the Guard. Dubbed the 'Warrior-Poet' for his love of poetry, Kazakov became the leader of the first Mari state.\n\nThe Republic became another success story for Northern Russia. Kazakov stabilized it, hoping for cooperation with other Idel-Ural states and Arkhangelsk."
 
 TaS_leader_name_Sergey_Belozerskiy: "Sergei Beloselsky-Belozersky"
 TaS_leader_name_Sergey_Belozerskiy_Tsar: "Sergei I"
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_DESC: "Mladorossy Russia has cleansed itself of its dark past through virtue and determination to revive the nation from ashes. We succeeded thanks to all who cared. Among them is Tsar Sergei Belozersky.\n\nElected by the Zemsky Sobor, the Tsar earned the title 'Tsar-General' for his military roles in Berezniki. Previously, he served Nicholas II and the US Army. He returned to help his people regain greatness—a task only the Mladorossy can achieve.\n\nNow in power, Belozersky understands his responsibility. His firm grip and Mladorossy fervor will aid him. Supported by the nation, he must meet their expectations. Much work remains to restore order and unite Russia under one flag. Belozersky won’t shame his ancestors—he will surpass them." 
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_70S_DESC: "Tsar-General Belozersky united all free Russia. As a distant Rurikid descendant, he proved his legitimacy, crushing enemies in their pseudo-states. Combining modernity and tradition, he earned the title of true Mladorossy Tsar. The Russian people rise again, undeterred by past horrors.\n\nYet, Belozersky won’t stop here. Nothing can restrain Russian vengeance for the Great Patriotic War defeat. The people will liberate Moscow, as fate decrees. Belozersky will emerge victorious.\n\nSome worry about his advanced age. Time is short—Russia prepares for a sacred campaign, like Minin and Pozharsky.\n\n§RTo Moscow§!."

 TaS_leader_name_Alexey_Kosygin_Tsar: "Alexei II"
 POLITICS_ALEXEY_KOSYGIN_DESC: "If anything can be said about Alexei II Romanov, his Zemsky Sobor victory was unexpected. The experienced Komi Republic politician gained enough popularity to become Tsar.\n\nNow, his past as 'Kosygin' is over. He’s no turner’s son but Nicholas II’s heir. Though known only to a few, this truth may surface. Until then, Alexei II Romanov aims to unite Russia, justifying his title as 'People’s Tsar'. What will result?"
 POLITICS_KOSYGIN_POSTBOMB_DESC: "If anything can be said about Alexei II Romanov, his Zemsky Sobor victory was unexpected. The skilled economist became Tsar of a new, people’s kingdom.\n\nYet, ruling revealed the crown’s weight. Old Mladorossy manipulated the Tsar, limiting reforms. An unexpected assassination freed him but pushed the state to collapse.\n\nNow, Alexei II is the true ruler, determining the state’s path. Emergency measures are needed. It’s time to end fragmentation. Let traitors tremble—the Red Tsar claims his birthright."

 MAR_Cyril_Yelita_Vilchkovsky_hog_desc: "§YFirst Minister\nAristocratic Conservatism§!\n--------------\nCyril Yelita-Vilchkovsky was born in 1906 into a noble aristocratic family. From childhood, he was an intelligent boy and always dreamed of becoming an influential official in the Government of the Russian Empire. The revolution destroyed these hopes, and his family was forced to flee first to the south to the 'Whites,' and after their defeat, the Yelita-Vilchkovskys went to France.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, Cyril became acquainted with the 'Mladorossys' party and even met its leader, Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek, in person. Thanks to his charisma and work ethic, he quickly became the party's secretary and the right-hand man of the monarcho-socialist leader.\n\nTime passed, and dark clouds gathered over Europe. On September 1, 1939, thunder finally struck—World War II began. In early 1940, Yelita-Vilchkovsky was arrested by the French government on suspicion of espionage but was released shortly after France's defeat. Upon learning that Kazem-Bek had dissolved the party, he joined the 'Fighting France' movement, like many former Mladorossys, but due to the Reich's victory, Cyril was forced to flee with a group of American volunteers.\n\nAfter the war, the Mladorossy resided in Atlanta, occasionally crossing paths with Alexander Lvovich. However, the start of the West Russian War drastically changed his life. Kazem-Bek invited Cyril to participate in 'Project Sun'—a CIA operation to infiltrate loyal U.S. emigrants into the power structures of the pro-German Vladimir III's forces. Soon, Vilchkovsky and his comrades returned to their homeland. Though the initial infiltration plan succeeded, Vladimir still harbored suspicions. Thus, Cyril now must help his friend outwit the Tsar and finally save Russia from Judas."

In 1911, he enrolled in the Page Corps of His Imperial Majesty, graduating in 1914 with the rank of cornet in the Life Guards Cavalry Regiment. Belozersky also participated in World War I, ending it as a staff captain commanding the regiment's second squadron.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he fought in General Yudenich's White Army, fleeing to Britain after its defeat and eventually settling in France. However, Sergey found himself back in Britain at the start of the war, joining the Royal Air Force. After bloody battles, he evacuated with the remnants of the British forces to the U.S., where he continued serving in the U.S. Army until retiring as a major in the early 1950s.\n\nWith the outbreak of the West Russian War, the Rurik descendant was recruited by the CIA as a military expert for 'Project Sun.' Subsequently, he traveled to Russia with the Mladorossys, where he became Minister of Defense under Kazem-Bek.\n\nDespite his past, Belozersky strives to aid his homeland, but only time will tell how he will achieve this."

 MAR_Alexey_Kosygin_eco_desc: "§YMinister of Economy\nMladorossy Absolutism§!\n--------------\nLittle is known about his origins. What is clear is that he possessed a sharp mind, which allowed him to head the People's Commissariat of Light Industry by 1939 and oversee Siberian development projects. When the war began, he was tasked with evacuating industrial assets to Siberia.\n\nAfter the defeat in the war, he was forced to join the West Russian Revolutionary Front, holding various positions in the economic ministry while attempting to alleviate the people's suffering. He also engaged in backroom dealings to eventually lead the Front.\n\nWhen the West Russian War began, he managed troop supplies, but due to rebellions and outdated equipment, this proved challenging. After the Front's collapse, he was accused of undermining combat readiness and sentenced to execution. Using his connections, he escaped and was captured by a Mladorossy detachment. After a brief imprisonment, he was recruited by Kazem-Bek. Thus, the red minister found himself in the den of collaborators and former Whites. Fate works in mysterious ways."

However, after being captured early in the war, he defected to the Germans, becoming another of Himmler's lackeys, slaughtering people in Ostland.\n\nBefore the war, he was transferred to Muscovy, collaborating with industrialists in Tambov and protecting them from partisans. With the outbreak of the West Russian War, he switched sides to the Reds, betraying all German officers and commanding a division under Tukhachevsky. However, after the West Russian Front's collapse, fearing retribution for his past, he betrayed his patrons once again, fleeing with a loyal group of soldiers to the Mladorossys, where he offered his services.\n\nTime will tell whether he will betray his patrons again or not."

His ranks steadily rose, allowing him to become chief of staff of the 229th Rifle Division on the eve of the war.\n\nThe war changed him. Unlike most of his compatriots, he 'had to switch sides.' Until the West Russian War, he served in an SS punitive brigade, but after its outbreak, he betrayed his German comrades. He joined the Red Army forces, befriending Tukhachevsky. After the Front's collapse, he found himself in Berezniki, joining local armed formations. Over the years of service, he embraced the local ideology. For his merits, he climbed the career ladder, reaching his current position as head of the MGB and Prime Minister.\n\nThe assassinations of Belozersky and Kazem-Bek altered the state's situation. Henceforth, decisions rest with Gil—and he will act with military coldness and rigidity.\n\nNo pretender shall go unpunished."

During his studies, his ideological fervor, participation in public movements, and recitation of self-written poetry were noted. From his school days, he was inspired by Russian military leaders, aspiring to perform feats for Russia. His loyalty to his country and desire to help seemed boundless. Joining the front against Germany in the war's final weeks, Anatoly never fired a shot—the Red Army was in full retreat while he was training.\n\nHe failed. Failed. It seemed he was broken, unable to save his country when it needed him most. He dedicated himself to military science as an act of atonement for the deaths of millions of compatriots he couldn't protect. In the new world, he was alone. Yet, Anatoly studied strategy on the battlefields of Western Russia, later applying his knowledge during the West Russian War. As a young general, close to his subordinates, he led the Red Army in a successful offensive. Subsequent defeats on the frontlines battered but didn't break him. After the country's collapse, he found himself in Berezniki. Later, he bitterly fought against former comrades now on the other side of the barricades. For his service to Berezniki, he was made a field marshal.\n\nProving over decades that he is a son of Holy Rus', Anatoly Vavilov inspired young soldiers and officers who studied his biography in capital military academies. After the terrorist attack and Kazem-Bek's death, he became Minister of Defense. In his post, like dozens of glorious Russian commanders, he stands guard over his homeland—Russia."

All available resources will be deployed to increase the number of mines. But an immediate pathological question arises: who will dig them? Naturally, we must employ workers, but there are not enough to maintain the required pace, so we will have to use prisoners.

Time is pressing, as Vyatka is losing patience due to Kazem-Bek’s behavior, and even the modest profits from salt sales and similar have vanished. Thus, we must use all possible forces to compensate.\n\nThese compensatory forces are concentrated in the peasants, who will feed our nascent industry.

But Kosygin’s plan itself raised questions with Bek.\n\nAfter several heated debates, it was decided to revise the plan, which originally emphasized developing social services for citizens to spur them to work harder for the Motherland. Kazem-Bek, being less optimistic, pushed for changes, now focusing primarily on increasing industrial capacity and workers’ living standards rather than all societal strata. This may provoke some public reaction, but the state’s welfare must remain the top priority."

A herd of fanatical but foolish workers is not the best option for filling factories and mines. Thus, we urgently need to solve this nagging problem. Knowing that the new is the forgotten old, we should look to the past for answers.\n\nA simple and brilliant solution emerges. In the 1930s, the Soviet Union practiced a method called workers’ faculties—university departments focused on imparting experience to collective farmers and mid-level workers. Reviving them with partial conceptual changes will resolve this issue, which has been a stumbling block in completing the reforms."

This is a major victory for Kosygin and his allies, granting them extensive influence in the government. But most importantly, it allows the plan to be implemented, lifting Berezniki from its knees through a path Kosygin himself deems correct and optimal in this situation.\n\nThe plan entails long-term growth through improved living standards and state social programs. This will motivate the population to work much harder and more efficiently, strengthening our industry. Moreover, improved living conditions will give the governorate’s population far fewer reasons for discontent and, consequently, uprisings against the government."

To stimulate educational attainment, they will be made free, and almost everyone in our small state will receive at least basic knowledge. We must also seriously revise higher education, which has been self-sufficient for many years.

Since Alexei Kosygin became Minister of Economy, we have seen prospects for the future.\n\nWith Kosygin’s plan for industrial reform and restructuring, we have achieved phenomenal success.

Nevertheless, their knowledge, oratory, and managerial skills are of the highest caliber, making it difficult to choose among the candidates.\n\nThe dilemma lies not only in the candidates themselves.

Before him stood a desk with another batch of paperwork, but he had no desire to tackle it now. Kazem-Bek approached the mirror installed in the study and gazed at his reflection. \n\nHe scrutinized the reflection intently. He examined the attire of the Governor of Berezniki, peered into the eyes of his loyal comrade Vladimir, and tried to glimpse the soul of the CIA operative codenamed 'Spider.' Yet the longer he stared, the clearer the thought echoed in his mind: 'This is not me.' Then he realized he could not see Alexander Kazem-Bek — the patriot of his homeland, the Mladorossy — anywhere. His true essence lay buried, like a slate where every new word had been written over the old. \n\nThe blizzard outside grew fiercer, yet his thoughts sharpened. The leader of the Mladorossy began to understand that over the years since fleeing Russia, he had nearly lost his identity. Life had dealt blow after blow, obstructing his grand vision for a new Russia, and it seemed Alexander had surrendered. He had accepted himself as merely another cog in history's machinery, destined to vanish into oblivion or be replaced when the time for repairs came. \n\n'This shall not be!' Kazem-Bek declared before returning to his desk. Clearly, it was time to set long-brewing plans into motion — to restore Russians' faith in the Tsar and Soviets, to reunite Russia, and guide it to true greatness.

'The trucks are in order. Good,' Anton thought, turning to his deputy. \n\n- Sergeant Rudin! \n\n- Here! \n\n- I’ll go with the reinforcements. You hold the outpost. Lieutenant Kaleda will relieve you tomorrow. Report back once you return. \n\n- Yes, sir! – Rudin saluted and vanished into the darkness. \n\nThe truck crawled along the dirt road. Lieutenant Anton Leskov hated escorting convoys. The route through the village of Karagai to Berezniki ran perilously close to Permheim, and traveling at night through the triangle of abandoned villages — Mendeleevo, Beloborodovo, Grigoryevskoye — made him count his loaded magazines every time. He usually caught the drivers’ sidelong glances but didn’t care. Just a hundred kilometers separated them from the Aryan Brotherhood’s lair, and vigilance was paramount. Yes, Anton despised this duty, but convoys carrying weapons and medicine were the iron guarantee that the province could defend itself, heal the wounded, and treat the sick.

This applies to everyone. – He pulls out a cigarette, lights it, and inhales deeply. – Herr Rudin demanded a hefty sum for intel on this convoy. – Gunter surveys the battlefield. So much Russian-Aryan blood spilled over some pathetic decoy. Even if they were willing slaves of the Judeo-Bolsheviks and the puppet Tsar, they were still Russian-Aryans. Gunter turns away from the trucks, tucking his left hand behind his back. 'If cosmic balance holds, the nation lost part of its genetic wealth. Thus, they must gain equal or greater.' With this thought, he flicks the cigarette butt theatrically and spins around. \n\n- Waldemar, are we rich? – Gunter stares at the soldier, who opened a green crate only to shut it immediately. His eyes gleam with pure rapture, akin to touching the music of the Elder Wagner. Gunter knows the answer and smiles. \n\nGunter Stuttgart storms into the Führer’s residence hall, soldiers trailing with green crates. Gutrum Wagner rises angrily. Gunter kneels. \n\n- Mein Führer!

I see no reason to trust you or sacrifice my flock for your ideas. – Antipin locks eyes with him. \n\n- Do you recall what Jesus asked Peter? – Alexander says.

Everything proceeded according to plan, and soon they would be ready for the impending war with their southern 'neighbor.' The defensive strategy against the Aryan Brotherhood seemed sound and unneeding revision. \n\nSuddenly, Belozersky entered the hall with a report on the southern border’s defenses. Belozersky asserted that building a defensive line would offer little advantage against the Aryan Brotherhood, citing the Maginot Line’s circumvention as an example. Thus, a defensive tactic, even followed by a counterattack, was fundamentally flawed. \n\nNodding at the explanation, Kazem-Bek asked: 'What can we do to improve our chances?' Sergei Sergeyevich Belozersky calmly summarized his conclusions: 'We must devise a new strategy from scratch, and I will personally ensure it is done swiftly.' Alexander Lvovich agreed without hesitation. \n\nBelozersky retreated to his office, summoning high-ranking generals and commanders. After outlining the strategic dilemma, he demanded they craft a radically different plan within a week. \n\nA week later, three plans emerged. The first proposed a swift, deep preemptive strike before the enemy fully mobilized. \n\nThe second was unorthodox: allow the enemy to invade, then encircle and cripple their main divisions to gain numerical superiority. \n\nThe third, deemed dubious, advocated alternating offensive and defensive phases to swiftly end the war. \n\nYet the final decision rested with Belozersky."

Kazem-Bek read them, sighed, and chose his words carefully. \n\n- Yes… Your lineage is ancient, but the 1612 Zemsky Sobor proposed stranger candidates… \n\nBelozersky shook his head, bleary eyes fixed on his regent. \n\n- You want me to become Tsar. – A statement, not a question. \n\n- Yes. \n\nAn eternity passed.

Kazem-Bek, Vladimir Gil, and provincial archivist Andrei Borisovich Eliseev pored over the papers. \n\n- Look, Alexander, everyone’s a Romanov now. – Gil smirked. – The scent of power rouses even taxi drivers’ descendants. – He spat. – Bastard pretenders. \n\n- Speaking of Elisei Nikolaevich? – Andrei Borisovich adjusted his glasses, stroking his beard. – A collateral line. Grandson of Xenia Alexandrovna, Nicholas II’s sister. A morganatic marriage and German army service, but he fits. Vladimir, after all, is no saint. \n\n- We need a decision. – Kazem-Bek frowned. \n\n- I suggest reviewing Samuil Golferstadt’s documents. \n\n- That’s Sam Johnson. – Gil turned to the archivist. – Where’s the royal blood? \n\n- His grandfather emigrated to the U.S., but… – Andrei Borisovich shrugged. – Such things happen. \n\n- Can he even speak Russian? – Gil scowled. \n\n- Presumably. – The old man nodded.

May I meet her? – Alexander asked. \n\n- Of course. – Vladimir nodded. – Anastasia Alexandrovna, bring Maria. – The governess departed. Half an hour later, a girl in a blue dress entered. Her curls were neatly styled, blue eyes gleaming with curiosity. After courteous greetings, Kazem-Bek inquired: \n\n- Which subjects do you favor? \n\n- Mathematics and French. – She clasped her hands behind her back, tracing a line with her shoe. – And Russian literature. – Maria glanced at Anastasia and stood rigidly. \n\n- French? – Alexander raised an eyebrow. – Why not German? \n\n- Papa speaks it often.

Without any greetings, the man immediately said:\n\n- Do you know anything about concessions? – The train driver barely had time to open his mouth before he was immediately interrupted:\n\n- Alright, do not answer; it does not matter. What matters, young man, is that I have just received a telegram from Berezniki. It states that these very concessions have been liquidated by our government. And that means you do not have to go to Vyatka.\n\n- And what am I supposed to do? – the driver asked in confusion.\n\n- You must drive the empty train into the depot. Do not worry about its unloading, my assistant has already explained everything to the workers. They will receive double pay upon completion of the work. And you, just wait.

 MAR_initial.26.t: "Protest from Vyatka"
 MAR_initial.26.d: "Bek was in his office when he was informed of the incident. He was looking out the window, yet not really looking anywhere. All his thoughts were focused on what had happened. Because of some foolish soldiers who had come to oversee the loading process, he would now definitely have to explain himself to Vladimir. Why did no one stop the soldiers, why did they pass through the checkpoint without hindrance, and why did they easily enter the loading hall… Too many questions, but there would be only one answer: an explanation to Vladimir.\n\nA telephone call echoed through the room. It was clear who it was – it was Vyatka. Moreover, from there would come the irritated yet tactful voice of Vladimir, asking about the incident. “Perhaps we should deny everything? Or maybe they are not even ours? Or perhaps… No, utter nonsense,” thought Kazem-Bek to himself. But his thoughts were interrupted by the incessant ringing of the phone, alerting him of Vladimir’s call. “We must act decisively and without panic!” he realized as his hand betrayed him by bringing the receiver to his ear.\n\n- This is Kazem-Bek at the phone, – he said calmly.\n\n- Well, hello, my dear, – said the sardonic voice on the line, – I did not expect to have to speak with you today, but circumstances require it.\n\n- Circumstances represent a monstrous error, Vladimir.\n\nOf course, it was an error; what else could it be. And I am absolutely convinced that the blame for what happened lies primarily with my men. But still, try to explain to me the reason behind the arrest of my inspectors who were sent to the station last night. And I ask you to explain your decision to abolish the concessions.\n\nA painful silence fell. Vladimir was clearly one step ahead, which gave him the right to attack first – and the right to make a mistake. And Alexander had only one chance to answer. He had to choose exactly what sort of answer that would be."

There is some mistake! What have I done?” asked the station master.\n\n“You are accused of treason in the form of abolishing the concessions of His Majesty Vladimir III. For this arbitrary act, you are under arrest!”\n\n“But it was not I who ordered it! It was an instruction from the telegram!”\n\n“I am not interested in why you did it. The fact is, you did it.

 MAR_initial.28.d: "It seemed that the shift lasted forever. The same actions were repeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times. Constant explosions could be heard from different directions, though they had become familiar by now. Tons of rock had to be processed to extract even a modest amount of valuable minerals, which in itself was an extraordinary stroke of luck.\n\nBut as always, the workday came to an end and the workers emerged in groups from the intricate tunnels—tunnels whose lengths spanned tens of kilometers, explored by geologists and riddled with TNT explosions. It was also the end of Vitaly’s workday. He had grown accustomed to the work and was satisfied with his position as the head of the brigade. Yet even he was astonished by the volume of work he had to perform.\n\nThe workload gradually increased, as did, among other things, salaries and vacation days. He tried to explain all of this to his wife, but she still insisted on his resignation, for he hardly saw the children and did not participate in their upbringing. Occasionally, arguments escalated into threats of divorce, but nothing ever came to pass. It seemed that the family would remain on the brink of disintegration due to the father’s overwork, but then one day everything changed.\n\nThe evening sky soothed Marina, who was drinking tea with pastries in the kitchen. The children were already asleep, and she too was about to go to bed. But suddenly the front door opened and the head of the family entered the apartment. Marina’s astonishment knew no bounds. She stood in the doorway, unable to utter a word, when her husband joyfully shouted:\n\n“Children, Daddy is home!”\n\n“Why are you shouting? They are already asleep!” protested the mother.\n\n“Oh, come now, at long last I am home on time, and not empty-handed!”\n\nHaving finished his sentence, he produced from behind his back a hefty bag of groceries. At that moment, the children ran out of the room and began embracing their father. An astonished Marina was rendered speechless, but she too rushed to embrace her husband.\n\n“Vitya, where did you get that?” she asked joyfully.\n\n“They counted it as overtime at work. As the head of the brigade, I received the highest payment, and the boys even contributed, saying that I indeed work the hardest and bear all the responsibility.”\n\nOnce they had calmed down, they all sat at the table to share dinner with their provider."

 MAR_initial.29.d: "The fresh morning air filled the small square in front of the school, where a formation was taking place. A huge number of children, who until recently had been street urchins and thieves, could now attend school like everyone else. It is clear that not all wish to receive an education, but the primary purpose of schools is to educate and only afterwards to instruct.\n\nNonetheless, one class stood out for its high level of discipline and calm. It was class 7G. Most of its pupils were ordinary children, and only a few had been newly assigned. Yet the class teacher – a young woman named Irina Konstantinovna – was visibly anxious due to the sudden influx of students during the current academic year.\n\nBut soon everyone calmed down and the principal delivered a ceremonial speech, extolling the importance of education and proclaiming that it was now accessible to all. Naturally, the government of Kosygin, which had facilitated this reform, could not be overlooked. Shortly thereafter, the assembly ended and the classes proceeded to their respective rooms.\n\nClass 7G belonged to Irina. Her anxiety was evident to the naked eye; consequently, her deputy, Oleg Igantyevich, decided to assist her by escorting the class to the auditorium. Everyone took their seats as the bell rang. Quickly taking attendance, she stood up and said:\n\n“Well then, children, we will now have a lesson on civil defense. Anticipating your questions, in this lesson I will explain the sequence of actions to take in emergencies. By the way, what emergency situations do you know?”\n\nAfter receiving several answers, she sat down at her desk and continued with the lesson."

 MAR_initial.30.t: "The Test"
 MAR_initial.30.d: "Danya woke up to the rays of the sun shining directly in his face. And although that brief contact with the outside world was extremely short, it managed to eradicate every trace of sleep from him. Grumbling, he sat on his bed and looked up at the loft. It was still six o’clock in the morning. Too early for his ordinary self, too late for his eccentric self. Yet he had a plan for the day.\n\nReluctantly, he began his exercises. And no matter how much his mother objected, one had to do what had to be done. Then he washed and, with a look of discontent on his face, went to the kitchen. Nothing was ready there yet. The kettle had only been placed on the stove, and the frying pan was heating up for frying eggs. All that remained was to sit at the table and re-read a certain chapter of the literature textbook, so that his mother would not say anything.\n\nBut time flew by quickly and soon breakfast was consumed in its entirety by Daniil. With nothing else to do at home, he changed clothes, gathered his school supplies, and headed to school. In truth, he did not want to and had no intention of going to school that day, for a test in civil defense had been scheduled—a subject he detested. But since his parents’ trust had run out and it was difficult to devise some clever plan, it was decided that he and his friend Kolya would quietly slip away to the countryside and spend the whole day there.\n\nThe plan, it seemed, was perfect. Some of their comrades were bribed by truant students to inform Irina Konstantinovna that they had gone to the city with their families so that no one would worry about them being caught. Moreover, finding them would not be easy. They all collectively decided to hide in an old hut by the lake in the countryside. But one main question remained—where was Kolya? At the appointed time he did not appear. “What a friend! He has betrayed us!” Danya cursed internally, when suddenly Nikolai appeared in person and said, “Well, why are you hesitating? The bell is about to ring, let’s go quickly!”\n\nSo they left the village. Walking along the country road, they chatted about various things, joked, and laughed. Essentially, the plan was a success. Everything was going perfectly until they both heard a strange noise from afar. Stopping, they listened. The sound was odd, unlike anything they had ever heard. But what was frightening was that it was rapidly approaching. Soon the roar subsided and it seemed as if nothing had happened, when suddenly, very close by, a deafening explosion thundered. Then another. And another!\n\nIn the sky, airplanes with crosses on their fuselages appeared. “GERMANS!” shouted Kolya as he dashed along the road. Danya was also in shock, but amidst a million thoughts he recalled a brief excerpt from the civil defense lesson when Irina Konstantinovna had said that in the event of an airstrike one should lie down in a sheltered place and cover one’s head with one’s hands. Recalling these simple truths, Danya immediately pulled his friend by the collar into a ravine, where they both lay down. Literally within seconds, a nearby building was destroyed by a bomb dropped from one of the airplanes.\n\nSoon the nightmare ended. The airplanes flew away, but the boys did not emerge from the wet ditch for another half hour, fearing a repeat. Finally, convinced that there was nothing more to fear, they emerged. Standing on the freshly bombed road and looking at the ruined factory nearby, they both wept. Through tears they said to each other:"

 MAR_initial.31.d: "In one of the makeshift shelters in the houses sat Tamara Pavlovna. She had long since bid farewell to her youth, and all that remained for her was to sit at home, occasionally stepping outside. Only her daughter Arina remained as a glimmer of hope in her life.\n\nThe entrance door creaked. A young woman in a worn uniform entered. The old woman sprang from her chair, hardly believing her eyes, and approached her daughter:\n\n'Arina, what is that you are wearing?'\n\n'This? It is a military uniform. Beautiful, is it not?'\n\n'Military? On you? How did that come about? Stop it!'\n\n'I will not stop. I am joining the army. I will defend the Motherland.'\n\n'Have you lost your mind, or what? Without you, those bureaucrats will manage just fine. In short, life has improved, the rations have increased. You should have married and lived peacefully, instead of joining the army!'\n\n'Perhaps they will manage, but only if everyone decides to remain at home; who will then defend the Motherland? Who will throw themselves in front of enemy fire to protect their comrades? Who will defend their parents from attackers? That is exactly the point.'\n\nAfter these words, the girl in the military uniform turned around and left the house. The mother understood everything and decided not to stop her daughter. And exactly ten minutes later, a new cadet arrived at the military unit."

 MAR_initial.32.t: "Cadets"
 MAR_initial.32.d: "How wonderful it is to do something useful. You immediately become useful, feeling a connection to something great and something that will help people. These were exactly the emotions Arina experienced when she finally became a full-fledged cadet of her regiment. The examinations were passed without difficulty; on the contrary, the girl was even reprimanded for her eagerness to help the Motherland.\n\nIn the academy, she was one of the most talked-about. Many men were astonished by her courage and determination, but there were also those who believed that women in military affairs were a burden. They constantly threatened Arina with various punishments whenever they saw her, yet she never lost her optimism and remained friendly. However, one day she had to confront the phenomenon known as hazing.\n\nWalking through the corridors of the barracks, Arina was suddenly seized by the hand by a man in his forties or fifties who rudely said:\n\n'Listen, quickly mop the floors while no one is around!'\n\nStunned by such expressions, she stood for several seconds in a state of shock until he shoved her to the ground. Her attempt to stand ended with a heavy, wet rag falling on her head, and above came the words:\n\n'Come on, perform your duties in the army!'\n\n'There is nothing that I must perform!' – Arina protested.\n\n'You damned wretch!' roared the man as he pressed her against the wall.\n\n'What are you doing? Let her go!'\n\nBut he could no longer hear anything. Covering her mouth with his hand, he began removing her uniform when, unexpectedly, a blow struck his head from behind. A moment of silence ensued, and the senior officer collapsed to the floor. Following him, another cadet appeared, standing with a mop in hand. The awkward silence was broken by the newcomer’s words:\n\n'What a wretch! I must report this to the commander!'\n\n'Yes, indeed, we should…' – Arina muttered shortly as she finished dressing.\n\n'Oh, excuse me, I did not introduce myself. My name is Olya.'\n\n'Arina,' she replied briefly.\n\n'Do you know anything about him?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Alright, let us give them our location, and they will find this little fellow.'"

 MAR_initial.33.d: "The rainy weather outside evoked a sense of melancholy in Marina. Although their financial and humanitarian situation had noticeably improved thanks to increased payments and rations, the family was still on the verge of divorce. He constantly worked in the mines, sparing no one as he honestly strove for the benefit of the country and the ideals of the Party, yet he also risked his life. And the children were left with her alone. It seemed that such a situation would continue until she declared, 'Either the family or the work!' and he would remain lost in that matter.\n\nBut one day an event occurred that drastically changed their relationship. He again stayed late during his evening shift. Marina intended to wait for him for a while, but he did not come – most likely he had stayed for an extra shift or simply decided to sleep there, or perhaps… No! He is not like that! He may work for days in the mines, but he is a loyal husband. Although these thoughts in her mind gradually faded away as she drifted off to sleep, they did not entirely vanish.\n\nThe morning was, as usual, gloomy. She got up, dressed, washed, and was about to wake the children when she suddenly noticed a plate on the kitchen table. She remembered clearly that she had cleared everything away the previous evening, so she decided to check it. She was even more surprised when she saw her favorite pancakes on the plate. It appeared as though some unknown force had done all of this, when unexpectedly a bouquet of flowers appeared from behind her. She nearly fell from fright, but Vitaly, standing behind her, caught her.\n\n- Vitaly? – she asked in surprise.\n\n“Good morning, dear,” he said, handing her the bouquet.\n\nIn a state of complete shock, she could not utter a word until he interrupted the silence:\n\n“Look, Mari, what they gave me at work.”\n\nTaking an envelope, he carefully opened it and read: “Leave notice for fourteen days.” Delighted, she embraced her husband and quietly said:"

Gathering in front of the factory’s main office, the workers quickly surrounded the arriving director. He, in turn, swiftly began his speech:\n\n'Comrades workers! Today you are being provided with the most modern apparatus, which is destined to elevate our factory to an entirely new level both in production and technical terms. I wish for you to break all existing production records of every enterprise in Berezniki. Hurrah!'\n\nThe crowd enthusiastically echoed “Hurrah!” But soon that director departed for his own matters, leaving the workers alone with the new machine. It looked formidable and instilled in those present a sense of power at the mere sight of it. It seemed that its very presence would double the production capacity.

In attempting to determine the cause of the shutdown, he committed several gross violations of safety regulations. Shortly thereafter, during an inspection, the machine returned to normal mode. The worker did not manage to withdraw the hand he was using to check the contacts and connections and received a fatal electric shock. The ambulance confirmed the death of A. N. Parfyonov. As a result of a short circuit, the machine’s internal wiring caught fire, rendering it irretrievably unusable. I request further instructions.”\n\nFrom the director of the factory R. V.

The deceased A. N. Parfyonov is to be handed over to his family for burial, and they must be paid compensation in the amount of one hundred rubles. As I understand it, this incident occurred due to a failure to observe safety protocols; therefore, I demand stricter safety measures – in particular, the mandatory wearing of rubber gloves and the presence in each workshop of a medical team capable of providing immediate assistance."

 MAR_initial.36.d: "The summer season had passed. At last, Artem could breathe deeply. The summer session was long over, fading from memory like a terrible dream, and a bright (unfiltered) future lay ahead. At least, that was what he thought, as he decided to take a chance: to apply to the nearly newly formed Faculty of Electrical Engineering at the Berezniki Institute.\n\nThis decision came to him unexpectedly but with conviction. After reading about the event in the newspaper, he decided that he should consider this option, as the completion of the tenth grade unmistakably pointed to choosing a university with a faculty. Weighing all available options, he concluded that his only correct choice was to enroll in the workers’ faculty, where he would receive a first-class qualification as a skilled worker. Moreover, he found studying exceptionally easy – meaning that in case of an error, he could easily transfer to another faculty.\n\nA beautiful sunny day on the first of September inspired everyone present at the inaugural day of the newly established Electrical Engineering Institute of Berezniki. Today they were to undergo a complete orientation with the professors, classrooms, and all the other formalities that would help or hinder them during five years of study at the university. But first, everyone was gathered in different auditoriums, where the faculties were divided. In one such room was Artem.\n\nHe listened eagerly to everything said by the stately men and women, trying not to be distracted by the chatter around him. It seemed that he was the most interested person in the room. Even the professors did not display as much enthusiasm as Artem. He could not wait to explore every nook and cranny of the building, for he truly desired to do so. Of course, such behavior did not go unnoticed, and the head of the faculty quickly approached him and led him aside. Inna Grigoryevna, as she was called, said to him:"

And although the session ended very quickly, he still remained as long as possible to absorb as much knowledge as he could. He had almost the entire month of July to rest and gather strength before his fifth and final year. It would seem that he should relax completely and enjoy himself, but he worked tirelessly day and night on his project.\n\nThen one day, during one of those late work sessions when Artem was diligently writing and calculating, someone knocked on the door. A little disoriented, he thought it must have been his imagination, but as soon as he resumed his work, the door shook again with another knock. Rising from behind his desk, he walked down a dark, unlit corridor into the entrance hall, where he opened the door.\n\nStanding outside were his professor Inna Grigoryevna and two unknown men – one of advanced age and the other young and energetic.\n\n“Good evening, Artem,” said Inna Grigoryevna to her best student.\n\n“And good evening to you as well,” the young man stammered.\n\n“May we come in?”\n\n“Oh, of course, please come in.”\n\nSeated in the kitchen of the young student, the woman began the conversation:\n\n'Artem, I have an important matter to discuss with you, and as you can guess, these charming men are not here merely for show. Oh, pardon me, I forgot to introduce: this is Ivan Karlovich Robershney, and this is his best student, Vasily Ukhlonov. And Ivan Karlovich has a proposal for you, please.'\n\n'Thank you. Well, hello, Artem. Rumors about you have been circulating throughout the city. They say that you are one of the strongest students in the entire institute, just as Vasily once was.

But he was not allowed to linger in this state for long as a knock came at the door.\n\n'Enter,' he said softly. Although he uttered these words quietly, the door creaked open and a young man—dressed almost in a student uniform and carrying a huge stack of papers under his arm—entered.\n\n'Good evening, Comrade Kazem-Bek,' he mumbled uncertainly.\n\n'Hello,' the head of Berezniki said in a stern voice.\n\n'I have a report for you regarding Kosygin’s plan. Where shall I place it?'\n\n'Place it on the table. And tell me the time.'\n\n'It is half past eight.'\n\n'Very well, you are dismissed.'\n\nA chill ran through Kazem-Bek as he took another drag on his cigarette. After a brief pause, he stubbed it out and placed it in a beautiful faceted ashtray on his windowsill. Closing the window, he sank into his chair and began studying the documents. Many reports from various enterprises and mining companies flashed before his eyes. A cursory glance at the folder yielded several surprising conclusions, even exceeding Vladimir’s expectations. But what struck him most was the final stack of papers, which, according to the stamps, was written personally by Kosygin. It spoke of phenomenal results of the plan, the growth of industry, and future prospects.

And as time approached half past eleven, Belozersky had not yet appeared, although he was supposed to arrive half an hour earlier.\n\nBut finally, the office door was disturbed by a knock.\n\n'Enter,' Bek said briefly.\n\n'So why do you need me?' Sergey snapped without greeting.\n\n'And why are you so nervous today?'\n\n'Must I explain it to you? You understand everything; just do not get me worked up, please. So, there are many urgent matters.'\n\n'Alright, get to the point: I wanted to talk to you about the reform of the army.'\n\n'Again with the same old story. I am tired of explaining that we cannot reform the armed forces and that it will not help us.'\n\n'Do not be so critical; we must act. And for that, I have two scenarios.'\n\n'Well then, present them.'\n\n'We can attempt to restructure and rearm independently, relying on the experience of previous Russian wars. This will earn us the support of both the populace and the army, but it will be a rather long and unreliable path.'\n\n'And what is the second scenario?'\n\n'We can use our old CIA networks to ask Uncle Sam for help. Then both the qualification and the armaments will be exactly as needed, but we will have to make certain concessions, which will likely cost a considerable sum of money. The choice is yours."

In an effort to shield himself from this natural wonder, he could think of nothing better than to move the table away from the window. This procedure took him enough time to regret his decision, but abandoning it would have meant rearranging that wretched piece of furniture all over again.\n\nBut finally, the task was completed and he calmly resumed his work. As the CIA resident in Brittany, he oversaw many operations on the black market of that state, through which a colossal amount of information passed. Yet on this day, something clearly went awry. A phone call forced him to divert from his business and go down to the apparatus to answer.\n\n“Hello,” Henry said curtly.\n\n“Henry, this is Lewis. You are receiving a call via cable.”\n\n“And what? I am busy today, as I told you yesterday.”\n\n“I understand perfectly, but this is the headquarters, so please come as soon as possible.”\n\n“Damn it… Alright, I will be there soon.”\n\nIn the context of this conversation, “headquarters” meant that the call was coming from America via a cable hidden from the eyes of adversaries. Despite his personal plans, Henry had no choice but to dress and head to the resident center to answer. The early morning was quite warm, but the wind was raging along the coast of the strait. He quickly reached the suburb in his car, where the CIA phone booth was located. A few minutes of silence passed as Henry listened until a gruff voice of Colonel Brain sounded in the receiver:\n\n“Is this Henry?”\n\n“And who else could it be?” Henry remarked sarcastically.\n\n“Do not try to joke with me,” the voice thundered.\n\n“My apologies, this is Henry, I confirm.”\n\n“That would have been better from the start. Now listen, the matter is serious but not difficult; you will manage it.”\n\n“Excellent. What is it this time?”\n\n“You must transport a shipment of armaments to… Berezniki… That is, to Berezniki, in Russia. There, our former comrades reside. They have asked us, based on old friendship, for weapons.”\n\n“Damn it, Brain, you know that supplying weapons to Russia is a losing bet. We could ruin everything!”\n\n“That is why we are entrusting this task to you, as one of the best in the black market. Organize everything there; the report is due this evening. Good luck.”\n\n“May you be cursed, you son of a bitch!”\n\nBut that outburst dissipated into the silence of the early morning nature."

 MAR_initial.41.d: "A column of trucks drove along a bumpy road, bouncing on every hump. Yet almost all the passengers paid no attention and calmly continued with their business: some cleaned their weapons of caked-on dirt, some recounted stories to their comrades in misfortune, and some even managed to sleep while bouncing every ten seconds. The road stretched on endlessly, leaving them with nothing but waiting…\n\nBut one day was unusual. Typical Russian landscapes gave way to villages and small towns. Finally, in the latter half of the day, the column entered a town. Admiring the city, they marveled at the level of development of the Russians, for they believed that Russia was nothing more than the ashes of its former glory, burned by the Third Reich. Upon reaching the central square, the guide said: “Welcome to Berezniki!”\n\nThere, a small group of people – presumably military – was already waiting. Their uniforms revealed their identity. Ultimately, from eight trucks, about one hundred American mercenaries, exhausted by a week-long journey, disembarked. Despite their fatigue, they formed up and greeted their comrades from Berezniki. The unit commander King emerged with an interpreter to speak with the head of the welcoming group.\n\nThe interpreter approached the Russians and requested to speak with their leader. From the crowd emerged Sergey Sergeyevich Belozersky. After shaking hands, the conversation began:\n\n“Welcome to Berezniki!” began Belozersky.\n\n“Greetings, comrade!” said the interpreter.\n\n“Well then, I see you are ready to begin service in the depths of Russia!”\n\n“Certainly!”\n\n“That is wonderful, but I would like to meet your personnel personally – forgive the redundancy.”\n\n“Not at all. However, I would like to ask for your name.”\n\n“Oh, pardon me, I forgot. I am Sergey Sergeyevich Belozersky!”\n\nSuddenly, several heads peered out from the tightly formed line of Americans. Observing the Minister of Defense, they became anxious. The commander was about to shout at his subordinates when he was unexpectedly interrupted by Belozersky himself.\n\n“Oh my! Fred! And Gilbert!”\n\nEmbracing each other warmly, Sergey attempted to explain the situation. It turned out that these were his long-time acquaintances from the war in Britain – people he had not expected to see again, and now such happiness had occurred. Quickly bidding farewell to the arrivals and leaving them to the mercy of the Berezniki troops, Belozersky and his comrades rushed to his car to spend several hours engaged in warm conversations about the past."

 MAR_initial.42.t: "The Results of the Scam"
 MAR_initial.42.d: "A column of trucks was driving along the roads of a ruined and beheaded Russia. The cargo had arrived here through the ports of Brauchichstadt, whose local docks had been pre-bribed by the European CIA management. And now the cargo was moving through scorched wastelands to deliver equipment to Berezniki. But before the end of these adventures, the convoy had to pass one of the most critical tests of the journey – the Vyatka customs officers.\n\nDue to some radical actions by the governorate, the trust between Vladimir and Bek had catastrophically deteriorated, which tightened all levels of border control. Fearing smuggling and the reinforcement of Berezniki, Vladimir ordered that every convoy traveling the route to Berezniki be inspected. This factor became decisive in the creation of the “Humanitarian Mission of Emigrants from the United States.”\n\nThe checkpoint appeared unexpectedly through the fog. It was a complex of several buildings where multiple stages of inspections had to be carried out. Due to the high risk, it was decided not to offer any bribes and to proceed, so to speak, completely cleanly. After stopping the column, the customs officer decided to accompany the convoy leader to inspect them. As they proceeded, they saw only trucks packed to the brim with boxes stacked on top of one another.\n\nThen they reached a somewhat empty truck, and the customs officer decided to climb in to inspect something for himself. A brief inspection of the interior – if it could be called that – caused great agitation among two drivers. It became clear that the scam was doomed when a soldier lowered one of the boxes onto the floor of the truck and requested it to be opened. Holding their breath, everyone stood silently watching the slowly opening lid of the box. It seemed that something irreversible was about to occur. Everyone mentally bade farewell – if not to life, then certainly to freedom…\n\nBut unexpectedly, from the box the soldier produced a children’s book and a can of American-produced stewed meat. Taking the found items, he thanked them for the gifts and said that they could proceed."

 MAR_initial.43.d: "Rain drummed on the roof of the three-story polyclinic building where Nikolai was located. He sat in the corridor opposite room 32, twirling a piece of paper that read: “Polyclinic 4, Saturday, 11:. We will find you.”\n\nIn fact, that note had come to him after a lecture at the division’s institute where he studied. Nikolai, unusually clever and physically developed for his age, was one of the best in his field. The note arrived shortly after class. Not understanding its meaning, he decided to go to the meeting place and wait for a certain gentleman, who was most likely the author of the note. After all, it was Saturday and there was little else to do, as no other departments were troubled. But time passed, and no one came. Immersed in his book, he did not notice when a man sat down beside him.\n\n“What are you waiting for, comrade?” the stranger asked.\n\n“Me? Well… I am waiting for my acquaintance, who is in the examination room,” Nikolai lied, thinking that revealing the true meaning would be a mistake.\n\n“Ah, you are waiting for a friend? Well then, he has asked you to accompany him – would you mind?”\n\n“Very well,” he finally said, realizing that this was indeed the person he had been waiting for.\n\nQuickly leaving the polyclinic, they headed somewhere. The student did not wish to ask any questions, as he did not know the rules of the game, and silently agreed with the leader. Thus, they quietly arrived at a house located near the square. Entering it, Nikolai wanted to ask a question but refrained. “It is not worth breaking the conspiracy,” he wisely reasoned. Ascending to the second floor, they entered a typical apartment and proceeded to the kitchen.\n\n“Would you like some tea?” the stranger asked.\n\n“Thank you, no.”\n\n“Very well then.”\n\n“Excuse me, but may I ask you a couple of questions?”\n\n“There is no need, for I must first ask you some questions. So, I am a representative of the CIA’s special unit in Berezniki responsible for training new personnel, and I believe that you are ideally suited for it.”\n\n“The CIA? That is to say… Am I correct in understanding that you are offering me to join the special forces and receive training there?”\n\n“Exactly, young man. You meet the criteria both physically and mentally. The decision is yours.”\n\n“Give me five minutes.”\n\n“Please.”\n\nAfter long and conflicting deliberations, Nikolai was finally ready to give his answer:"

 MAR_initial.44.d: "Comrades! Our primary task today is to formulate the fundamental postulates of our new doctrine! And for that, I have invited you here, for we must study the works of past years to compile the most comprehensive list of tactics. As Lenin said: “Study! Study! Study again!”\n\nWith these words, Belozersky began the meeting at the army headquarters in Berezniki. As the text indicates, the meeting was intended to establish the core concepts of the new military doctrine. To study the enormous amount of works from previous years, an old acquaintance of Minister Bayerli and a former officer of the Soviet Army, Anatoly Vavilov, were invited. Belozersky was convinced that his knowledge of the Soviet Army would undoubtedly prove useful in creating the doctrine.\n\nHowever, the process of studying was tedious and lengthy, and soon the meeting turned into an evening in a library. A profound silence was accompanied only by the sound of pages being turned and a pencil writing. Books were flipped through one after another, with a thought being transcribed from each, yet even such a volume provided a vast wealth of information that would later have to be structured and reinterpreted.\n\nCloser to midnight, the pile of books began to diminish, while the stack of read Soviet samples grew geometrically. The notebooks brought by Belozersky, Bayerli, and Vavilov were already heavily scribbled on, which was a positive sign – the more information there was, the more precisely the new military doctrine could be established. But finally, all three sat next to the high stacks of books they had just read.\n\n“Well then, I propose we summarize the meeting,” said the minister.\n\n“I agree with you,” replied Bayerli.\n\n“An analogous response,” muttered Vavilov briefly.\n\nSince a huge amount of material had been collected, I propose that it be forwarded to the documentation department, where it will be structured and analyzed. After that, I will convene you again for a final review. Are you all in agreement?"

And, by the way, how are they faring?' asked Pepeyalev with a smile.\n\n'You see, Anatoly Nikolaevich, times are rapidly changing, and we had to disband the Cossack units and, so to speak, transfer them from ordinary horses to iron steeds.'\n\nPepeyalev looked thoughtfully at his interlocutor and asked:\n\n'If I understand correctly, you are referring to tanks, Dmitry Fyodorovich.'\n\n'No, Anatoly Nikolaevich. We have converted them into motorized infantry.'\n\n'And where did you send the horses then?'\n\nLavrinenko paused for five seconds and said:\n\n'We sent them to the local hippodrome. Sergey Sergeyevich decided that it was more expedient to deploy the horses in civilian roles. Besides, their breed is excellent. Why risk them under bullets?'\n\nAnatoly pondered for a moment and replied:\n\n'Very well… Dmitry Fyodorovich, would you mind showing me your new Cossacks?'"

'I have reasons for having decided to submit my resignation. And let me tell you, aside from the fact that I am already in my seventies, there is something else...'\n\n- 'And what might that be?'\n\nPepeyalev rose from his chair and cautiously walked to the window in the office, located beside the table where Belozersky sat.\n\n- 'For example, the troops under my command do not recognize me as their commander. I have never been a Cossack! How can one command troops that do not regard you as their leader?!'\n\nBelozersky listened to his words, sighed heavily, and said:\n\n- 'Alright, damn it. You may consider that from this day forward, you are a military retiree,' said Belozersky, signing the resignation.\n\nAfter Pepeyalev left the office, Sergey Belozersky dialed Kazem-Bek’s number and, after the connection, said:"

In this, I believe, lay the primary mistake of the Red Army’s leadership, which thought not so much about preparing the operation as about reaping the rewards of vengeance.\n\nAfter these words, silence fell in the office, broken only by the ticking of the clock. Frunze and Belozersky watched as Frunze paced from one corner to another, pondering his words. They had gathered in a room in the Military Institute building and were engaged in a discussion about the Western Russian war and the reasons for one side’s defeat and the other’s victory.\n\n'But allow me to object,' said Belozersky, 'You claim that the blame for the defeat lies in the mindset of the Red Army leadership.'\n\n'Yes,' said Frunze, 'Moreover, I can say that if the leadership had acted wisely rather than impulsively, it is quite possible that we would have witnessed the revival of the Soviet Union.'\n\n'Well then, my friend, I regret to inform you that your perspective seems far too optimistic and positive. Undoubtedly, the Soviet Army could have avoided such a failure and perhaps even persuaded Berlin to come to the negotiating table. But here arises an important detail – the Wehrmacht. Although I am not a historian, I believe that even the Bolsheviks’ equipment would not have sufficed for such a crushing defeat of the Germans. Their technologies were rather advanced, and they could have mounted sufficient resistance if led in a coordinated and proper manner.\n\nFurthermore,' unexpectedly added Gil, 'let us not forget the dissidents within the ranks of the Red Army. I hope that no one will dispute that Germany conducted masterful recruitment of various Russian figures who later played an important role in undermining the combat effectiveness of the army. Vladimir III, Vlasov, various minor officials, and similar bands of traitors managed to effectively dismantle the organization and combat readiness, leading us to a repetition of the outcomes seen during Boris Godunov’s reign.\n\n'Well then,' said Frunze, 'each of us has our own perspective on the Western Russian war. It is undeniable that each is partly right and partly mistaken. And this is not worth even a moment of dispute among us. The conclusion is simple: the defeat of the Red Army was due to a number of factors that, alas, we either cannot or do not wish to acknowledge. A toast, comrades:"

 MAR_initial.47.d: "A frosty morning had arrived at the base of the 61st regiment in the vicinity of Berezniki. The sun had long been reigning in the barracks, yet it was not what roused the soldiers from their sleep since ten in the evening. The floorboards creaked under the weight of the person entering the room. Soon, the sounds subsided, only to be replaced moments later by a resounding call: “RISING!” The soldiers immediately sprang from their beds and hurriedly began to dress, then quickly made their beds. Although doing so swiftly was rather difficult, there was no time for relaxation – shouts from the company commander resounded in everyone’s ears: “Hurry up and assemble! You have absolutely no time; you are in peacetime, but what if there is an alert? Or, even worse, what if there is an emergency?”\n\nFortunately, soon everyone lined up and was ready to obey the commander’s orders. The well-rehearsed commands were executed swiftly, after which everyone proceeded to the “wash-up and comb” procedures. Cold water, cold air, and the chilly interactions between one another after rising – all of these created an uncomfortable yet deeply familiar atmosphere.\n\nThe soldiers did not linger long at the washbasins; soon they were lined up again, this time on the parade ground. The commander walked from side to side, nervously chewing a cigarette. It was clear – something important was about to happen. But finally, at the far end of the vast concrete field, a vehicle appeared, rapidly approaching the formation. Within a few minutes, it came to a stop near the company.\n\nFrom the vehicle emerged a young military man of about twenty-five years, who cheerfully greeted the company commander.\n\n“Greetings, Comrade Arshinov,” he said, holding his hand near his temple.\n\n“Greetings to you, Comrade Shchiptsov, at ease,” replied the commander.\n\n“Well then,” said Comrade Shchiptsov, turning to the soldiers, “greetings, comrades soldiers.”\n\n“Greetings, Comrade Shchiptsov!” rang out across the parade ground.\n\n“Allow me to introduce Afanasy Ignatievich Shchiptsov, who has been assigned as the political instructor for our – mercy – company.

All buildings were thoroughly searched, yet not a single one of the instructors that night managed to elude the coordinated and professional actions of the MGB special units.\n\nLate at night in Kazem-Bek’s office, the phone unexpectedly rang.\n\n“Hello,” replied Alexander in his customary tone.\n\n“I must admit I am shocked and pleasantly surprised by your actions,” came Vladimir’s voice from the other end.\n\n“This is… It is most unexpected to hear from you,” Kazem-Bek stammered.\n\n“Do not worry; I am truly impressed by your mastery.

However, as reports from the scene began to come in, inconsistencies started to appear.

It seemed that something had been overlooked, that some fragments of information had fallen into Vladimir’s hands. But there remained a chance that it was merely a coincidence – nothing more.

The halls and offices were literally empty.\n\nIt quickly became apparent that the operation had been known to the enemy in advance, perhaps from the very beginning of the plan’s development.

Yet after three seconds, Alexander regained his composure and found the courage to pick up the receiver and hold it to his ear.\n\nA conversation began between the governor and Vladimir, and judging by the tone of this exchange, it became clear that the \"Big Brother\" was displeased with what Kazem-Bek had been doing behind his back. When asked how the Tsar had learned everything, he invariably replied: \"the birds sang.\" It became clear to Alexander that the Tsar's influence over Berezniki was too great, and to bargain for a second chance, he had to painfully justify himself for a long time, inventing excuses on the spot just to avoid being ousted from his position.\n\nHaving concocted perhaps a dozen excuses, he nonetheless managed to bargain for a second chance at life and for the continued existence of Berezniki. Vladimir stated that he would forgive him for these antics, but only once, and demanded that nothing of the sort happen again – or else...\n\nHanging up the receiver, Kazem-Bek sighed with relief, yet the thought that he had failed to escape from under Vladimir's heel weighed heavily on him. This demonstrated that the Tsar's influence was too strong and that actions must be taken even more covertly.

Drawing his loaded pistol, he aimed at the door from which the small detachment would come. Receiving no response, Smyslovsky ordered the door to be forced open, but as the door was of good quality and to avoid wasting time, he simply ordered it blown open with a grenade.\n\nThe grenade explosion slightly stunned Kazem-Bek, but he immediately realized the assault on his office had begun. Thus, it seemed, Alexander's end had come, and so he decided to empty his entire magazine into the men.\n\nBefore the dust had settled, gunfire erupted. Judging by the sound, Kazem-Bek hit one of the soldiers, but the remaining bullets apparently missed, passing only near them.

Only a few garrisons stationed near the border attempted to offer resistance but were soon forced to retreat, unable to take any effective action during the clashes.\n\nFollowing the transfer of the Yurlinsky District under our direct control, an official appeal was drafted and sent to Vyatka, outlining the formal incorporation of Yurla and the corresponding territories into our jurisdiction. Briefly summarizing the content of this appeal, it should be noted that in accordance with an agreement reached several days earlier with the Kudymkar Governorate, a border demarcation was carried out, through which the Yurlinsky District was transferred to our jurisdiction.\n\nAt present, Vyatka has expressed no protest actions; however, to maintain security, several armed units will remain stationed in the occupied lands to be prepared for any potential reaction from the Vyatka government in the future. Concurrently, logistical connections between the district and the rest of our territories are being established. In the end, this operation proved to be an undeniable success."

 MAR_initial.58.t: "Heavy Battle"
 MAR_initial.58.d: "Alexander Kazem-Bek sat in his office, which had become his second home. In his hands, he held a letter recently received from Vyatka. He understood what topic would be addressed but still feared how it would unfold and what the outcome of events would be. Taking a final deep breath, Kazem-Bek opened the envelope and swiftly extracted a neatly folded sheet of paper.\n\n«Dear Alexander Kazem-Bek, we have swiftly become aware that your administration attempted to conduct an unauthorized demarcation of borders by deploying your forces to occupy the Yurlinsky District.\n\nThis action on your part significantly undermines the credit of trust we extended to you prior to this operation. We have studied the events and reached certain conclusions. We also specifically note the fact that during their retreat from Yurla, the garrisons stationed in said territory partially neutralized the production facilities of the district you occupied.\n\nNevertheless, despite all of the above, we will ratify this change on the maps, warning that any further such actions without central authorization are henceforth prohibited. To enforce this order, several authorized Okhrana agents have been dispatched to Berezniki to closely monitor compliance with our will. This concludes the matter. Fulfill your duties and do not violate established laws and borders.»\n\nAlexander set the letter aside, pondering: Was this game worth the candle? Certainly, Berezniki had gained control over the Yurlinsky District... But now they would face even greater pressure from the Okhrana, having received far less than initially anticipated."

 MAR_initial.59.d: "That day, the Ministry of Defense and Security building was crowded with journalists from various publications, ranging from the local \"Towards Young Russia\" to Vyatka's \"Rodina\".\n\nSuddenly, Defense and Security Minister Sergei Belozersky himself emerged before the journalists. At once, everyone unexpectedly began asking the same question:\n\n— Sergei Sergeyevich, what do you have to say about the incident in the Yurlinsky District?\n\nThe matter was that an armed clash had occurred in the Yurlinsky District of the Vyatka Principality. Upon inspecting the site, it was discovered that the attackers bore insignia of the armed forces of the Berezniki Governorate.\n\nAt this moment, Belozersky paused briefly and replied:\n\n— Gentlemen of the press. I have already been briefed on the events in the Yurlinsky District. This is a pure provocation aimed at tarnishing our relations with the Vyatka Principality. I will say this: had Berezniki's army indeed acted, Yurla would have been part of our governorate by the next day. This is all I wish to say regarding this incident.\n\nWith that, amid the journalists' demands for answers to their questions, Belozersky hastily exited the building. After all, he now had to explain himself to Kazem-Bek in person."
 MAR_initial.59.a: "Overconfidence leads to carelessness"

 MAR_postbomb.1.t: "Factory Agitator"
 MAR_postbomb.1.d: "It has been a short time since the bombings ended. During this time, the workers of the local 'grey' factory have grown accustomed to not hiding in basements and not flinching at the slightest noise resembling the sound of bombings. Now they were situated in a building that had miraculously not been destroyed by countless German raids. \n\nHowever, today brought another change in the factory's life. Unexpectedly, two officials arrived, intending to deliver a speech to the working class. Naturally, the workers themselves, still in their uniforms, gathered to watch. \n\n- Comrades, my name is Konstantin Chernetsky, I am a local official, and I have come to ask about your lives and how they might be improved. With me is my colleague, Viktor Ropshin.- Chernetsky gestured toward Ropshin, who then began his part of the speech. \n- You all know that these are difficult times. Of course, the German raids have ended, but the occupiers of Russian land around us seek to become sole dictators. This cannot be allowed, and to prevent it, we need not only victories on the front but also victories in the rear. For without victories in the rear, there are no victories on the front. That is why I urge you to work even harder. And remember: We do not abandon our own! We work to free Russia from ignorance and to instill the ideas of the Mladorossy! \n\nThe workers began to murmur among themselves.\n- And now, comrades, you may share your concerns, and we will try to address them in the future. \n\nThe workers suddenly started shouting.\n- Fix our roof!\n- Give us new tools!\n- Build us a road to the factory!\n\nHaving noted down all the grievances of the proletariat, the officials shed their uncomfortable overalls and donned the suits and coats they were so accustomed to. \n\n- Phew, now do you see who we are governing? - one asked. \n- Yeah, quite the bunch. \nBy the way, there's no one home right now, shall we go to my place? I just got some contraband chocolate. \n- Hot chocolate?"
 MAR_postbomb.1.a: "Oh yes, hot indeed..."

 MAR_postbomb.2.t: "From Grey to White"
 MAR_postbomb.2.d: "The path of an underground worker is a hard one. The fear of being exposed, the risk of being deceived by clients, the unclear prospects... But Gordey always thanked God that he was born in Russia, for the underground arms manufacturer was his only supplier in these divided lands. Of course, this opened the door to wealth and the exploitation of workers. Gordey did not shy away from the latter. They had nowhere to go, and no one would accept their complaints. \n\nThe weapons were not of the best quality either. Gordey had a stock of rifles dating back to the time when De Gaulle spoke of an undaunted France, and French girls easily and effortlessly gave themselves to the Germans. This was the most sought-after commodity across Western Russia. Other guns were modeled after this standard. \n\nBut all good things must come to an end. The Germans no longer flew over Russia, and the state now had the opportunity to take control of this sector of 'small business'. \n\nIt was morning when a GAZ truck pulled up to the underground factory, carrying three representatives of the Mladorossy authorities. All were armed. \n\n - The plan is simple: we go in, demand to see the boss, negotiate, and move on. Any questions? \n- Not much of a plan, honestly, but there’s not much choice. \n- Then let’s proceed. \n\nBut the 'negotiators' never got to execute their plan. Armed guards stopped them. \n\n- Where are you going? - asked one of the guards. \n- Would you be so kind as to call the boss? - the 'negotiator' retorted. \n- And who’s asking? \n\nSuddenly, the boss himself burst out from the basement, firing his pistol in all directions. All the bullets missed, and no one was hurt. Gordey ran out of ammo. The guards, stunned, couldn’t even move. \n\n- So you came to ruin my business, you bastards, scum! - the underground worker shouted in desperation. \n- Calm down, comrades, we came to make you a simple offer: you come under state protection, manufacture quality weapons for us, and provide social security for your workers. In return, we leave you alone and help you grow. Deal? - The 'negotiators' spoke through their gun sights, leaving poor Gordey no choice. \n- Ghhmmm, well, that’s profitable!"

 MAR_postbomb.3.t: "The First Congress of the Free Party"
 MAR_postbomb.3.d: "It had been about ten years since Prince Vladimir returned to Russian soil. It was then, at the age of 35, that Mikhail realized that serving the new Sovereign was a great idea. And he was not wrong. Even though Mikhail was merely a minor official, it was still better than continuing to work in a factory or as a smuggler. He had witnessed much bureaucratic nonsense, strict military discipline, and hypocrisy. A rather high price for a puppet position. \n\nAnd yet, it was worth it. And of course, none of it would have been possible without the Tsar. Mikhail held Vladimir Kirillovich in high regard. And many knew it. \n\nBut many years had passed, and now he was here, in a half-collapsed building that had once been a House of Culture. This was the first party congress since the final split between Vyatka and Berezniki. Everyone was extremely eager to learn about Kazem-Bek’s plans for the future. Officials whispered and discussed the situation. The atmosphere in the hall was tense. \n\nAfter 15 minutes, Alexander Lvovich finally stepped up to the podium. His face was unreadable. At last, he began his speech. \n\n- Comrades, a new era in our country’s history has begun. The spawn of Nazism is destroying itself, and new opportunities have opened up for us to save the Motherland. We have cast off the chains of Vyatka and are ready to move forward. Unfortunately, Vladimir does not understand this and still refuses to acknowledge the obvious. The secret police continue to destabilize the situation and kill our people. This is unacceptable! The MGB is doing everything in its power to prevent the influence of the criminal Tsar. I ask you to understand the necessity of these measures. I call upon all party members and the people of Berezniki to unite for our great cause. I call upon you to prevent the influence of the Kirilloviches on our politics. \n\nAt these words, two guards entered the hall, lifted Mikhail from his seat, and led him away to an unknown destination. Kazem-Bek took notice of him. \n\n- Apologies, it seems our servant is feeling unwell. Please, take him to the rest room."
 MAR_postbomb.3.a: "No more traitors."

 MAR_postbomb.4.t: "Personnel Revolution"
 MAR_postbomb.4.d: "It was a beautiful day in Solikamsk, and an equally beautiful exam was underway at the local party cell. This exam was for those wishing to join the Mladorossy party. Many aspired to join, as Berezniki's successes had significantly strengthened their power and authority. Among them were Gennady and his loyal comrade Dmitry. \n\n- Well, think you'll pass the exam? - asked Dmitry. \n- Yes, I'll pass without batting an eye. \n- You know, my old man said the same to my mom before joining the All-Union Communist Party. Now guess – did he make it or not? \n- I think he did. \n- You're bad at thinking. \nFinally, the examiner called Gena over and began the interrogation. \n- First question: Who founded the Mladorossy party? \n- Sergey Sergeyevich Belozersky. \n- Ahem, interesting. Next: What's the party's concept? \n- Reconciliation between Reds and Whites. \n- For what purpose? \n- For Russia."
 MAR_postbomb.4.a: "Excellent, but study the party's history."

 MAR_postbomb.5.t: "Necessary Measures"
 MAR_postbomb.5.d: "- Eliminate remnants of the Okhrana Department in Berezniki within a month? Have they gone mad? - raged the head of the capital's State Security Bureau in Gil's office.\n\n- Yes, Innokenty Konstantinovich. Direct order from the top. You're granted full operational freedom, including extreme measures. Report success in one month.\n\n- With all due respect, I lack personnel.\n\nGil paused slightly, rose from his desk, and asked:\n\n- How many men do you have, Major General?\n\n- About a hundred staff at headquarters. Plus fifty field agents.\n\n- Summon all personnel tomorrow. We'll brief operational details.\n\nThough drastic – Gil anticipated round-the-clock shifts – he knew Kazem-Bek would show no leniency. One month meant one month."
 MAR_postbomb.5.a: "We've been given operational freedom. And we'll use it."

 MAR_postbomb.6.t: "Tears of Joy"
 MAR_postbomb.6.d: "How long does love last? A month? Two? Three years? Perhaps not at all? Olga and Ignat could answer unequivocally: love lasts forever. They proved it through action. \n\nAfter the West Russian War, Olga sewed clothes from rags. Her skills spread through word-of-mouth – good tailors were rare in those hard times. \n\nIgnat served in the local militia. For his age, he'd seen much: veteran "samovars" (old artillerymen), decomposed elders' corpses, infants buried under bombing debris. Even underage orphan-prostitutes with nowhere to go. Though painful, better not dwell. \n\nThey met during Ignat's shift. That day's bombing destroyed Olga's home. That's when he first saved her life. \n\nThen came more – Vyatka's occupation, the Mladorossy' rise. None of that mattered. What mattered was standing before this house again. \n\n- Not so bad. The house still stands. - Ignat said optimistically. \n- Good heavens! Even the door's intact! - She pointed to a tiny bicycle in the hallway. - I rode this as a girl! \n- We're lucky, sunshine. Our descendants will live here. \n- Descendants? I like that thought."

 MAR_postbomb.7.d: "To: Defense Minister Sergey Sergeyevich Belozersky \n\nReport on Army Status and Resources Following Recent Drills \n\nThe drills spanned several days, encompassing tactical operations to emergency survival training. Necessary to confirm troop readiness for any scenario. \n\nUrban warfare and river-crossing maneuvers yielded satisfactory results. No communication or supply issues observed. \n\nConclusion: Current army condition meets combat readiness standards. \n\nRespectfully,"
 MAR_postbomb.7.a: "Field Marshal Joseph Beyrle."

 MAR_postbomb.8.t: "Countdown"
 MAR_postbomb.8.d: "Near midnight, Kazem-Bek convened an emergency war council. \n\nBelozersky arrived first – he'd anticipated this. Gil followed with customary cold stare. Beyrle and Vavilov next. Kosygin came last. All showed varying degrees of tension, knowing the meeting's purpose. \n\n- I'll be brief. We face fratricidal war – cruel but inevitable. Beyrle, Vavilov – mobilize troops. Kosygin – transition economy to full war footing. \n- Belozersky – command the army courageously.\n- Understood. - The Defense Minister nodded. \n- Gentlemen, are you certain of this path? - Kosygin asked. \n- Yes. \n- Unanimous. \n- Reconsider your plan while counting from 10. \nThey counted. Clock struck midnight as they reached zero."
 MAR_postbomb.8.a: "Midnight."

 MAR_postbomb.9.t: "Letter in an Empty Envelope"
 MAR_postbomb.9.d: "Amid life's frantic pace, it's useful to pause and collect one's thoughts. Perhaps answer questions: How did fate bring you here? Why are armed men searching your apartment? \n\nSuch thoughts occupied Vasily – high-ranking Berezniki official – as he faced his bare apartment wall. Surprisingly, he knew both answers. He was a Tsarist intelligence agent planted here years ago. Beyond official duties, he reported on Berezniki's internal affairs. The searchers were counterintelligence agents – not his first inspection, but previously he'd escaped exposure. \n\nUntil today. \n\n"Comrades! How long will this continue?! Third search this month – you've only frayed my nerves!" \n\n"Citizen, calm yourself. If innocent, you've nothing to fear." - The agent called to his partner - "Second! Find anything?" \n\nFrom deeper inside: \n\n"First! Look here!" - A burly man entered holding an envelope. \n\nDespair filled Vasily's eyes – they'd found the document stash. \n\n"For the record: letter addressed personally to Smyslovsky." \n\nAgents eagerly opened it, reading aloud: \n\n"...operational continuity threatened...weekly searches...request evacuation." \n\nGil's men exchanged satisfied looks before approaching Vasily."

Remarkably, neither time nor German bombers had destroyed this structure. Not quite how he imagined meeting the Grand Master of the Order of St. George - he'd hoped negotiations would be handled by diplomats in an ornate church. Though Antipin formally agreed to mediated talks, he demanded personal meeting with Kazem-Bek. Perhaps reckless idealism drove this behavior from a monastic warrior leader. Summoning courage, the Mladorossy leader knocked.\n\nThe door opened revealing a figure in full monastic garb. 'Enter, honored guest.' The sparsely furnished hut contained only a bed, stove, and table overflowing with icons. A steaming samovar and cups awaited. Mikhail initiated:\n\n- You want my men to join you, if I understand?\n\n- Precisely why I came - the Regent replied curtly.\n\n- Then I'll ask crucial questions. You seek to restore Soviets - those same tools Bukharin's godless regime used to behead dissenters and raze churches. Would you repeat this in Russia?\n\n- Never! Soviets themselves aren't evil - the Union's governance was flawed. We'll keep Soviets controlled, with Tsar's will as supreme law.\n\n- Fascinating system! But ideas alone won't reunite Russia from darkness. Are your intentions pure?\n\n- Doubt not - the Mladorossy produced a photograph.\n\n- So you silenced Wagner's Aryans? ...They deserved it.\n\nThe conversation lasted hours - monk and reformer debating Russia's fate, concluding with Antipin's vow: 'Now I fully understand you. My men will follow anywhere.'"

Inhumane fascists and Bolsheviks who lost the country, cloud-dwelling democrats, and dictators profiting off the people — your hour is near! The ideas you offer desperate souls bring only further ruin and decline to our great Motherland. Unknowingly, you’ve already lost the most crucial battle — the battle with the present. Your ideas lie on the roadside of progress. Look at the former collaborators in Samara — can traitors offer you a new Motherland? One you can proudly die for? And what can the northern Bolsheviks offer? They failed to protect you in the Great Patriotic War, failed to crush the Nazis in the West Russian War, and now can’t even feed themselves. How long must we endure this?! The Mladorossy movement differs from these worthless politicians, generals, and embezzlers. Unlike them, we embrace new ideas; our ideology moves with the times. We, the Mladorossy, declare openly and directly — your path is over. It is in your interest to cease resistance and lay down your arms. Accept us in your hearts, and we shall show mercy!'

For instance, the proximity of power to the people. Communist rule was far closer to the people than under Nicholas II. The Mladorossy seek similar closeness — but with a Tsar. Only thus can harmony and prosperity be achieved.\n\nAdmittedly, the communists believed in the right things — correcting many tsarist-era issues. Though Bukharin suffered a crushing defeat in the Great Patriotic War, many still believe in socialism. If it had truly failed, it would have been forgotten. Instead, communism persists — in Tyumen, Baikal, Central Siberia, even Arkhangelsk.\n\nAlas, we diverge. They reject a Tsar; we seek a people’s monarch.

Remarkably, even in peacetime, Kazem-Bek had to resolve hundreds of issues of varying magnitude. But the most significant question at this moment remained that of the Zemsky Sobor.\n\nHe had already determined the location for the Zemsky Sobor. Now, however, it was necessary to decide on the principles by which the electoral chamber would be structured. This question, in truth, was far from trivial, as Kazem-Bek believed it could deeply divide the political elites. In our state, the military currently wields immense influence — it was they who united Russia under the Mladorossy banner. They would undoubtedly demand significant weight for their voices at the upcoming Zemsky Sobor. Additionally, the industrialists, who have been appropriating more and more factories, could easily sway the decisions of this Sobor. Furthermore, the Mladorossy Party itself has never been sidelined in politics, and their opinion must also be considered. And, of course, the people — who are more a means to these elections, so to speak — must not be neglected either.\n\nKazem-Bek already had a rough template for the upcoming Sobor. Alexander was also inspired by the principles by which the Sobor of 1613 was convened, when the fate of the entire country was decided. He concluded that the same principles should be implemented, but adjusted to the current situation and the realities of the 20th century.\n\nAfter deliberation, he concluded that the Sobor itself should consist of 200 delegates. The first 100 would be representatives of the people. The people would vote for them through a majoritarian system, with each representative obligated to advocate for the interests of their district. If a district voted for a particular candidate, that representative would receive instructions from their district and cast their vote at the Zemsky Sobor.\n\nThe remaining 100 would be representatives of the military, industrialists, and prominent party figures who would choose their own candidates. These replaced the outdated concept of 'Boyars,' which had been absent from our country for over three centuries. These 200 individuals would ultimately vote for the chosen candidate."

Belozersky is a strong candidate for the Russian throne due to his close kinship with the Rurikid dynasty. Belozersky is related to them through the 19th generation, which serves as a significant advantage in his claim to the throne.\n\nSergei himself is also an extremely experienced commander. During the First World War, he distinguished himself as a capable administrator, serving as a staff captain in the Horse Guards. Later, he joined Yudenich’s army as chief of staff of the II Corps. After the Civil War, he moved to the United States and served as a major in the Air Force, returning to Berezniki following the collapse of the USSR and the defeat of the West Russian Front.\n\nDespite his rich military experience and Rurikid lineage, he was nevertheless considered a relatively mediocre figure — until recently.\n\nWith the onset of the 'Battle for Western Russia,' he gained considerable influence among the military elite, establishing himself as an exceptionally outstanding leader and commander. His army, if not adoring him, at least respects him for his contributions to Russia’s victory in this struggle. Moreover, the people, who witnessed the rise of the Mladorossy, observe that this ascent occurred not solely due to Kazem-Bek’s will, but rather through Sergei Belozersky’s efforts.\n\nFurthermore, Belozersky is respected not only by the general populace but also within the party itself. He is one of the oldest members of the Mladorossy Party and maintains strong connections and, consequently, support there.\n\nFinally, he stands a strong chance of securing votes from the economic elites controlling the military-industrial complex. These industrialists see in Belozersky an excellent opportunity to further enrich themselves and are thus willing to cast their votes in his favor.\n\nOverall, considering his prospects, they have grown significantly in recent times, and it is now reasonable to assume that he will become the ruler of Western Russia following the Zemsky Sobor."

 MAR_zemsky_sobor.5.d:0 "Maria Romanova, now only 10 years old, holds legitimate claim to the Russian throne. She is a representative of the tsarist dynasty overthrown nearly half a century ago. As strange as it may sound, recent mentions of the Romanovs among the general populace evoke, if not nostalgia, at least honor and respect. Even during Bukharin’s rule, a major campaign was conducted to slander the Romanov name, but it proved insufficiently effective. Even the fact that Vladimir III was a genuine Nazi collaborator elicits highly ambiguous feelings among the population.\n\nTechnically, Maria can lay claim to the Russian throne despite her age. However, she cannot rule due to her youth. At first glance, it might seem she has a greater chance of becoming Tsarina than Belozersky. But considering her age, this could drastically shift the balance of power in Sergei’s favor. Moreover, even if she were to become Tsarina, she would be unable to govern the country effectively.\n\nThere is a solution that simplifies matters significantly. Kazem-Bek already serves as regent, but he would advocate for Maria in this role while remaining the second-in-command of the state. Here lies an intriguing development — if Kazem-Bek positions himself as Maria’s regent, the people may end up voting not for Maria herself, but for Alexander Kazem-Bek. Kazem-Bek enjoys immense popularity among the common people, as he is seen as the unifier of Russia, albeit not without Belozersky’s assistance. The populace believes that Kazem-Bek formulated the policies, while Sergei Belozersky merely implemented Alexander’s ideas. Furthermore, there is a prevailing opinion that Kazem-Bek should continue ruling the country for the aforementioned reasons. This view is reinforced by the belief that a skilled administrator like him must remain in power as long as possible to prevent a recurrence of the devastation that followed the West Russian War.\n\nThis state of affairs would likely benefit Kazem-Bek as well, who may not wish to leave politics so soon after all he has accomplished. Thus, this 'Maria-Bek coalition' is quite formidable. However, even in this scenario, Kazem-Bek would rule only until Maria comes of age and assumes power herself.

Belozersky is quite popular now, while Maria’s support hinges on your ability to rule longer. This could lead to equal chances for both. What if the people can’t decide? This is entirely possible — I know from experience. — Kosygin paused, glancing at the newspaper on Kazem-Bek’s desk. — I could become a new candidate for the Russian throne. Recalling this newspaper, I can legitimize my claim and run as Alexei Romanov.\n\nAfter a moment’s thought, Kazem-Bek responded:\n\n- Frankly, I can propose that you become a backup candidate in case of a deadlock between Maria and Belozersky. — Kazem-Bek said. — That is, you would either draw votes away or become the Sobor’s chosen ruler as a unifying figure.\n\n- So, you’re truly offering me a chance to become a candidate? — Kosygin asked with some concern.\n\n- Yes.

After Komi’s dissolution, he became a notable figure within the party. His influence stems from earlier achievements and his political efforts within Berezniki.\n\nFrom birth, Kosygin astonished people with his exceptional mathematical abilities. Multiplying large numbers mentally, he rarely made errors. He was intellectually advanced for his peers. After the revolution, he managed a cooperative in Novosibirsk, amassing considerable wealth during Bukharin’s era. Later, he owned a textile factory in Leningrad. After the Great Patriotic War, he found himself in the Komi Republic, where a democratic regime had been established.\n\nRecently, rumors emerged in Komi that Kosygin was none other than Alexei Romanov — miraculously surviving the night of July 16-17, 1918. A local newspaper caused a stir by presenting substantial evidence supporting this: from facial similarities to personality traits matching Alexei Romanov. The theory posits that Alexei Romanov was adopted by Bukharin, given a new identity, and renamed. This would explain Kosygin-Romanov’s wealth during Soviet rule.\n\nHowever, many question this theory. Some dismiss it as a joke, while others fervently believe it. Nevertheless, Kazem-Bek considers it sufficient grounds for Kosygin to become a candidate via the Zemsky Sobor.\n\nHis chances of becoming ruler are slim. Kosygin is primarily known as Kosygin, with the Romanov connection familiar only in Komi. His reputation for democratic problem-solving and Komi-era achievements overshadow the Romanov rumor. Even if he assumed power, his legitimacy would be low due to public skepticism. He is unpopular among the military and intelligentsia.

Their influence is further evident in their role as electors for the new Tsar. Naturally, they will favor candidates pledging substantial military funding. Sergei Belozersky is currently the army’s darling.\n\nBelozersky is not only respected but beloved for aligning with military interests — he vows to spend millions, even billions, to maintain elite forces and continue unifying Russia. By voting for him over Maria (who also supports military funding but on a smaller scale), the army chooses its optimal path.\n\nTo gain any military votes, we must match Belozersky’s promises. Appearing on 'Voice of Russia,' Kosygin-Romanov outlined his military agenda. He argued that a modern army is indispensable given the enemies encircling Western Russia. A strong military guarantees independence and safeguards civilian prosperity. He concluded that quality, not quantity, was key — forces must be cutting-edge, equipped with next-generation weaponry to secure decades of dominance. Kosygin-Romanov thus pledged to develop advanced arms, even 'super-weapons.'\n\nAfter this broadcast, some soldiers began seriously considering voting for Kosygin-Romanov over Belozersky. While half the military electorate doubted Kosygin-Romanov’s plans, the other half leaned toward Alexei. The military vote is now split."

His influence in Komi proves his capability. Yet beyond Komi, he remains little-known, and the public doubts a Romanov could have survived. This undermines his appeal.\n\nKosygin must declare himself Nicholas II’s surviving heir to all Western Russia. To convince the populace, he needs not just propaganda but direct engagement — saturating radio, television, and print media to present himself as Alexei Romanov.\n\nThis requires media magnates’ connections. Kosygin reached out to Georgy Sergeyev (owner of Berezniki’s TV/radio stations), Artyom Konovalov (newspaper tycoon), and Kirill Biryukov (print media manager). Persuading them to promote him, Kosygin-Romanov began his ascent.\n\nKonovalov’s aid saw Kosygin-Romanov dominating front pages. Stories highlighted his 'contributions' — donating a tractor to a village for irrigation or thousands of rubles to war orphan funds. Notably, these acts were funded by sponsors, not Romanov himself.\n\nOn Sergeyev’s 'Voice of Russia,' Kosygin-Romanov appeared as a special guest. When asked, 'Is it true you were Bukharin’s adopted son?' he replied, 'Yes,' elaborating on the circumstances. Though implausible, listeners found fewer doubts the longer he spoke — for now."

Drawing inspiration from Russia’s history, he resolved to frame himself as a modern embodiment of the Rurikids.

To strengthen it and harness its potential for the Zemsky Sobor, we needed to lure exiled magnates back to their homeland.\n\nFelix Yusupov, once the second-richest man in the Russian Empire, now retained only the prestige of his family name. Though devoid of formal power, he maintained connections with White émigré industrialists possessing the capital we required. Belozersky penned a letter to Yusupov, urging his return. From his current residence in the United States, Yusupov deliberated and ultimately agreed, encouraging his associates to follow. While some capitalists adamantly refused to return, others repatriated willingly. A third group, motivated by profit and patriotism, began investing in Russian industry — recognizing the potential of cheap labor and nationalistic sentiment.\n\nThe return of these industrialists promises to catalyze economic growth while securing critical votes in the Sobor."

Priority was given to soldiers proficient in drills and formation marching. Approximately 10,000 troops were selected and dispatched. To showcase the Mladorossy state’s might, military hardware was also mobilized. Tanks rolled into the capital, while a nearby airfield temporarily hosted aircraft. Belozersky sought Kazem-Bek’s approval for the event — a request he could not refuse, despite recognizing its primary aim was to elevate Belozersky’s stature.\n\nPublic announcements declared the parade would commence at 10:00 AM. The procession was structured to feature battle-hardened units first, followed by Berezniki’s most advanced military hardware, and concluding with an aerial flyover. A military orchestra accompanied the spectacle, blending marches from the Russian Empire and select Soviet compositions deemed appropriate for the occasion.\n\nThe parade lasted nearly ninety minutes. Infantry marched commendably, though occasional missteps betrayed their lack of formal drill training. Following the foot soldiers, tanks emblazoned with the Mladorossy banner rumbled past — products of Gorky’s factories.

One short sentence, but the fate of Vologda hangs on it.\n\nGeneral Vasily Ivanov urgently gathered his most loyal supporters from the People's Assembly to discuss this difficult question. Ministers, senior officials, businessmen, and generals gathered in his office. Arguments began about the ultimatum. Some, namely the generals, demanded decisive action from Ivanov: preparation of troops, declaration of a state of emergency, and development of a defense plan against Beresniki. The other group, consisting of the majority (from officials to major businessmen), believed that "neutrality" was over and it was simply necessary to surrender to the mercy of Beresniki.\n\nVasily did not utter a word. He was too shocked by where his past actions had led him. Now they must be taken into account.

For this matter, Kazem-Bek called an emergency meeting of generals to decide on the future course of action. What were the plans for this meeting? As usual, there were two options: an ultimatum or a regular invasion. However, one of the generals, namely Ardachev, came up with a pretty good third option:\n\n- Comrades generals and Alexander Lvovich! I suggest a simple plan to you all, but it is also a brilliant one! The thing is, in 1963, the Democrats in the Komi Republic stood their ground, and their democracy has finally been strengthened. So, we need to take advantage of pro-Russian sentiments! Let's ask the Komi government to hold a referendum on joining Berezniki. After all, people in Komi know how we have already taken the south of Central Russia and see us as the unifiers of Russia. Therefore, if they refuse to hold a referendum, the republic will explode! Of course, they don't want that, so the referendum will be held. And then, as God sends, we will either win or lose, and that's when we can invade this country. But to be honest, - Ardachev raised his gaze slightly. - The chances of us losing are incredibly small. Checkmate, - Ardachev proudly finished his speech.\n\nThe generals began to consult with each other, as his plan was good, but there were still some issues. The Komi Republic has been in existence for about 10 years, which is enough time for "separatism" to arise. They will call themselves not Russians, but Komi, so they will reduce the chances of winning this referendum. And what are the chances that the leaders of this republic will simply refuse to acknowledge the results of the elections? There will be a regular invasion. Therefore, they considered this plan unnecessary. However, there were those who supported Ardachev without hesitation:\n\n- A good plan, Ardachev, which will allow us to annex them without bloodshed! - Vavilov said inspiringly.\n\nBut the floor was given to Kazem-Bek. Rising from his chair, he began to approach Ardachev:\n\n- Well, Ardachev, I'm impressed. This plan is truly brilliant. Well, comrades generals, - he turned to the other generals. - Soon, I will write a letter to their government requesting a referendum. And I hope that, as Ardachev said, the answer will be positive. As for whether this referendum will lead to good results, we will think about it later.\n\nThe generals began to nod in agreement with Alexander Lvovich.

Yesterday evening, the republic's government received a letter from Kazem-Bek, who demands a constitutional referendum in the Republic of Komi concerning the question of uniting Russia. Many members of our parliament reacted extremely negatively to this referendum. Party leaders also expressed their views on Komi's accession to Berezniki. \n\nNikolai Alexeevich Voznesensky, leader of the Democratic Socialist People's Party: "Of course, I and all the people of our party want the unification of Russia. All the people of our republic want this. However, we do not want to unite with Berezniki, where either the Soviet or the tsarist regime reigns. And we are confident that the people of our republic will express their unwillingness to unite with such a mixture of the Tsar and the Soviets."\n\nIvan Pavlovich Morozov, leader of the Union of Young Reformers: "The unification of Russia is good. And everyone knows this. But Berezniki are a bad option for unification. A country where a Regent rules without a Tsar should not be a unifier of Russia. Do you want to live under this regime without any freedom? Personally, I don't, but still, I am ready to give up freedom in exchange for the peaceful existence of Russia."\n\nSvetlana Iosifovna Alliluyeva, leader of the Party of Sovereign Democracy: "This is not even up for discussion! Russia needs democracy, not a crazy Regent without a Tsar! This power will split into left and right in a few years, and Russia will split even worse! Do we want this fate? Of course not!"\n\nAlthough party leaders expressed their negative views, most of the deputies still voted "For." Many knew that the people of the republic themselves would kill them for their "Against" vote. The referendum will be held in a few days, where the fate of our country will be decided."

The republic could explode again like it did in 1963. \n\nNikolai Yolkin was going to vote with his family at his native polling station number 17. Although Berezniki were not a free state, although this might be his last expression of will, his children would not experience the fate that he had. As a soldier of the USSR and the front, he witnessed the collapse of the country. And he wanted his children to live in a united Russia that could stand up for itself.\n\nAnd so the polling stations closed, and the votes began to be counted.

They all waved the flags of Bereznik and shouted the slogan: "Tsar and Soviets!" But there were also people with pickets saying "Killer of democracy." There were also many of them. Soon Kazem-Bek stopped in front of the government building, where he wanted to deliver a symbolic speech that would amaze not only the people of Komi and Bereznik, but all of Russia! Kazem-Bek got out of the car and, a little hoarsely, began to climb the stairs. When he reached his place, where he was supposed to start his speech, he was given a sheet with his speech.

Today, a peaceful merger of the Republic of Komi and Bereznik took place, where I became the leader of this merger. Many say that this merger will kill the democracy that Voznesensky tried to build. I will tell you that we must sacrifice freedoms and democracy to live much better in the future! Yes, many think our regime is insane, but I will tell you that you are afraid of this idea. The idea of legal justice from the Tsar and social justice from the Soviets! This is what Russia has wanted throughout its history. And our goal is to give Russia and the Russian people what they want! We will not back down from this idea, even if German or Japanese guns are aimed at us: we will remain loyal to Russia and help it and the Russian people! Hooray!"

However, Gutrum tried to escape, and when he got into the car and the driver hit the gas, he was discovered by a squad sent to detain him after just one turn. The escape failed.\n\nThe soldiers forced Gutrum out of the car and sent him to the first prison in Permheim. It was much easier with Wagner's supporters - they either surrendered to the forces of Bereznikov or didn't even try to run. When he and his associates were imprisoned, Bereznikov's intelligence agency was ordered to start searching for all documents that could indicate a crime against the Russian people. But Gutrum had already given orders to destroy any documentation in his administration, and although he didn't manage to destroy everything, much was lost, probably forever. Many facts of crimes were already hidden from our sight.\n\nHowever, even what we uncovered was enough to hand down a death sentence. In addition, this is confirmed by the testimony of several thousand slaves and some associates who believe that if they tell everything, they will be forgiven.\n\nAfter a very short period of time, the trial of Wagner and his associates began. Everything was done as demonstratively as possible, even film and cameras were used to capture all the moments of the trial. And, ironically, the trial was decided to be held in Permheim. Although Kazem-Bek had already given orders to rename the city Perm, the outdated name of the city was used during the trial preparations.\n\nThe trial, which was held over Gutrum, took about a day with short breaks. All this time, evidence and accusations against the leader of the Aryan gang were being read out. And even though he denied everything, all the people who were still on his side not long ago were against him.\n\nAs soon as the charges and evidence against Gutrum were finished, he seemed to have resigned himself to his fate and his eyes became empty, his gaze bewildered. In the end, the court gave the final verdict: the highest punishment - execution.\n\n12 hours after the trial, in the middle of the night, the verdict was announced and 5 members of the firing squad were sent to Gutrum. Wagner, in the last second before his death, managed to shout, "Heil Gutrum!" The shot was fired... He fell dead.\n\nThe same was done with all the other accomplices, but without pompous phrasing, and someone at least tried to repent, but Themis, the goddess of justice, is uncompromising.

They had become friends in the struggle for Western Russia... It was very sad, but those were the conditions. If Kazem-Bek had delayed his attack on Vyatka, the czar himself might have tried to destroy him.\n\nAfter several hours of a difficult journey, he arrived at the residence. The residence itself was not damaged during the fighting, as few people could even reach it. Nevertheless, there was no security here. And overall, there was no one here, as Vladimir had been placed under house arrest on Kazem-Bek's orders.\n\nOccupying this residence, he ordered to bring Vladimir III to this residence, who is now relatively close by. After a day, Vladimir III finally arrived and got out of the car and headed to the residence.\n\nExchanging greetings and asking how they were doing, Kazem-Bek suggested they go to the second floor and continue the conversation there. Upon reaching the second floor, you could see portraits of some of the Romanovs - Alexander III, Nicholas II, and others.\n\n"Vladimir, I want to say that we have certain plans for your daughter, Maria Romanovna," said Kazem-Bek.\n\n"What plans? Nothing bad will happen to her?" Vladimir asked cautiously.\n\n"We want to make her the ruler of the new Russian state. It turns out that I myself will not be able to rule for long due to political circumstances, and after all this mess in Western Russia is over, I want to nominate her as a candidate for the Russian throne."\n\n"As a candidate?" Vladimir III asked. "So it's possible that she won't become the ruler?"\n\n"Exactly, because after the end of the turmoil, there will be the Zemsky Sobor, which will elect one of two candidates, including your daughter. If the Sobor votes for her, she will become the queen," said Kazem-Bek. "If she becomes the queen, until she becomes an adult and independent, I will be her regent."\n\n"And if she's not elected?" Vladimir asked.\n\n"Your daughter will be sent to you as a father for further education. We will not do anything else with her, just like with you," Kazem-Bek said.\n\n"What is my fate?" Vladimir III said.\n\n"I suggest you give up political activity. I can return your servants, your residence, and leave your noble title, but in return, you take an oath not to engage in politics. I will keep my word that you will not be touched after you promise not to participate in the country's life."\n\n"It's sad that it turned out this way, but I'm glad you're giving me the opportunity to at least keep this in my old age. I will sincerely believe that you will lead Russia further to prosperity," Vladimir said with sadness, but with an understanding that his political activity was over from now on.\n\nAfter this conversation, Kazem-Bek returned to Bereznikov to continue his political affairs, while Vladimir began his new, more peaceful life."

 MAR_smuta_occupation.3.d:0 "After the war, there are many generals imprisoned who were on the side of Vladimir III. Many of these generals were ideological supporters of Viatka, serving their king since the time of the West Russian War, and they definitely bear the stigma of collaborationists. Despite the fact that they were enemies of the Russian people, having sided with the Germans, they were nevertheless good military specialists who put up worthy resistance to our troops during the fighting. This suggests that their leadership talents are still noticeable.\n\nWe could have judged them the same way as in Perm and executed them all by firing squad. However, Kazem-Bek believes that these people could still be useful to the Motherland. The army of Bereznikov is quite scarce in senior officers purely due to the population factor, and to ease the situation, we could recruit several such generals into our service.\n\nBelozersky instructed his subordinates to convey the proposal to the generals to take the military oath to Berezniki and the Party of Mladorossi and begin military service in exchange for their freedom from prison. Such a proposal was sent to all the generals, but almost all of them refused to give the oath to Kazem-Bek himself. Many of them say that Mladorossi are traitors to the Russian monarchy. In their opinion, when we were still on the same side against the Revolutionary Front, we were still fighting for the right, white cause and the cause of the king, but what we just did can only be interpreted as betrayal. Some of them considered us their friends, but some generals took this betrayal very bitterly and have strong dislike. Some still believe that the struggle is not over and the Tsar will return. As for collaboration with the Germans, they believe that you can fight against the red plague even with them, as long as it is not for the Reds.\n\nClearly, it is dangerous to release such generals even on parole, let alone take them into service. But among all the ideological composition, there are two people who still agreed to take the oath to the ideas of Mladorossi. Evgeny Eduardovich Messner, an ideological anti-communist, agreed to take the oath under the pretext of fighting the communists. He believes that this is definitely better than rotting in prison and seeing how the Motherland is divided into communist and royal. He found enough common ground in our ideas, though he has big questions about our ideology. The second person, Zagaynov Georgiy Prokopyevich, fully and almost without words agreed to take the oath to Kazem-Bek and the people of Bereznikov.\n\nA week later, they solemnly took their oath, changed the color of their uniform, and joined the service of Mladorossi Russia. And although some people raise serious concerns about the loyalty of the new regime, we must follow the principle of "trust, but verify" with them. We will put our special services to monitor them and look for all information about their activities. Therefore, their lives will depend on what they will do behind our backs."

While protests of the Communists are still flaring up in Komi, here in Berezniki the fate of three people is being decided: Boris Nikolaevich Ponomarev, Andrey Alexandrovich Zhdanov, and Svetlana Nikolaevna Bukharina. They all belonged to different factions in the Communist Party of Komi. Some had more power, others had less, but this did not diminish their guilt in any way.\n\nKazem-Bek personally attended the trial and personally gave "suggestions" to the judges before the start of the trial. Many already knew what awaited them. Soon the whole process began. A detailed description of the lives of the convicts and their influence in the Communist Party of Komi began. Soon the chief judge stood up, looked at all three convicts, and began his speech:\n\n-So! Today a trial is taking place over these people. And we are ready to announce our verdict to these henchmen of the Communist Party of Komi. So, the first verdict will be announced to the black horse of this party, namely Boris Nikolaevich Ponomarev, - the judge turned to the old man, who coughed a little. - For your political activities, tyranny, anarchy in Komi, and betrayal of the Motherland, you are sentenced to the highest measure of punishment - the death penalty!\n\nPeople began to talk to each other. Ponomarev already looked like an old man during his captivity, but to punish him to such an extent? Let him spend his last days peacefully. However, no one argued with the judge. The judge continued his speech:\n\n- Our next convict is Andrey Alexandrovich Zhdanov, - the judge turned to Zhdanov, while Ponomarev was taken to a "special" place. - For his political activities, participation in terror against the Russian people, he must be sentenced to death! - Zhdanov lowered his head. - However, due to his cancer and his scientific work, which helped society a little, Zhdanov will be sentenced to 20 years in prison - Zhdanov did not expect such a fate and even burst into tears.\n\nSoon the judge continued his speech:\n\n- Svetlana Nikolaevna Bukharina, - he turned to her, who had been looking into the eyes of her judges the whole time. - For your political activities and participation in the war against Berezniki, you are sentenced to 10 years in labor camps. The trial is over.\n\nThe trial was over, the convicts were taken away: two were sent to trucks, where prison awaited them, and one was sent to the woods...

Two men in white shirts, one older and one younger. The older one was Lev Gumilev, a Eurasianist, and the younger one was Igor Shafarevich. \n\nThe chief judge began the process with Gumilev. First, he began to talk about his life and about Eurasianism in a very negative way. Many thought that the judge would soon turn to insults, but this did not happen. At most, he called Gumilev "insane". Next up was Shafarevich. They also began to describe his life, his scientific activities, and then got to his political activities. One could hear notes of ridicule from the judge about Shafarevich: "...one cannot engage in politics with knowledge of mathematics."\n\nSoon the judges began to negotiate with each other. After five minutes, the judge went out to the people to announce the verdict:\n\n- Comrades! Our court is ready to announce the verdict for these people. So we will start with Gumilev: for his political activity, for organizing extremism, creating a regime of "fear", Lev Gumilev is sentenced to death! But due to his mental health, he will be sent to a psychiatric hospital, where he will recover, if he ever recovers, - by that time Gumilev was already taken away. - Shafarevich! For your political activity, for your complicity with Gumilev's clique, you are sentenced to 20 years in prison. However, for your scientific activity, we reduce the sentence by 10 years, - they pronounced on Shafarevich. - The court is adjourned!\n\nPeople began to discuss the verdicts: why send Gumilev to a psychiatric hospital if he can just be eliminated? He is the leader and should deserve a true punishment. But everyone agrees on one thing: the "Passionariy" party is dead, and Bereznyaky has strengthened its position in the political arena."

 berez_news.2.d:0 "Grigory is one of the police officers and has taken a good position in it. In Berezniki, he is the chief of police in the city. He was respected by many, invited to various holidays, but despite many stereotypes, he is an honest, fair and kind person. He does not just sit on his ass straight, but even participates in dangerous operations! And so, news comes from a mine located near the city. There was a collapse! They say that several people are stuck there and they need to be released. And he was appointed head of a special rescue team, those who have not yet been released from the mine.Gregory quickly assembled a team of the most professional and loyal people. All of them quickly took all the necessary equipment. The truck was ready to go to its destination:\n\n-We will drive about 15-20 minutes. We'll get there quickly, don't worry! the driver said with a smile.The truck started moving, and Grigory decided to smoke so that time would fly by faster, and his team was still discussing whether there would be dead or not. A strange topic for discussion, isn't it? Suddenly the truck stopped abruptly, and Grigory dropped his cigarette because of this. He got a little angry:\n\n-Listen! How did you get your license? Grigory said sharply and quickly.\n\n-Sorry, chief, for the sudden braking, but look for yourself!\n\nThe team got out of the truck and was horrified. They found themselves at a collapsed mine. The truck turns out to have crashed into a rock that rolled out onto the road. There were people and ordinary police standing near the collapsed mine. Grigory felt guilty:\n\n-Sorry for the bias. I didn't know all the details.\n\n-Nothing! I'm not offended, I'm already used to it.\n\n\n\n The team approached the people. Everyone immediately recognized Grigory: they began to beg, beg to save their loved ones who were overwhelmed. But they did not listen to them, they immediately went to the entrance, which was not yet blocked."

They were lucky that there were no forks, they didn't have to split up. Finally, they saw two men who were shouting at the top of their lungs. One was a young man, about twenty years old, with curly hair, and the other was an old man, Grigory gave him fifty years, all gray, in good physical shape. The young man was yelling to attract attention. They were heavily crushed by a huge boulder weighing about 150 kg:\n\n"Rescuers! Oh, God! I thought my first day in this dirty mine would be my last! If my dad had taken his well-deserved vacation instead of bringing me here on a tour, we wouldn't be lying here!"\n\n"Shut up already! It's sickening to listen," his father hoarsely and barely managed to say, attached to the ground with him.\n\nWithout any hassle, the team started lifting the stone. The stone was not too heavy, so after a few seconds, the people were freed. We learned their names: the father's name was Yegor, and his son's name was Ivan. Yegor was barely breathing, even though he was in good physical shape, old age takes its toll. Grigory picked him up and began carrying him towards the exit:\n\n"Thank you, young man," Yegor barely whispered.\n\n"I'm just doing my job. By the way, is anyone else stuck here?"\n\n"No, we were the last ones when we tried to exit the mine."\n\n"That's good..."\n\nAnd finally, they emerged into the light. The only woman in the crowd ran to Ivan - she was his mother. Grigory approached her, and Yegor got off his back and hugged her. That's what it is - a reunion!"

During his escape, German sentries shot him in the leg, and Simon had to crawl to the nearest village to get help. After recovering, he decided to stay in Perm and serve as a priest there, but after the collapse of the Western Revolutionary Front and the establishment of the Aryan Brotherhood in Perm, he fled to neighboring Berezniki. With the money he had earned from his service in Perm, Simon founded a church in the northwest of Berezniki, near the Ural Mountains.\n\nAnd so a new day began. Simon was already burying new victims whose bodies were brought to him, poor people who had been accidentally hit by bombs. People kept coming and coming. Suddenly, his assistant, Priest Arkady, called him.\n\n"Father! We don't have enough coffins to bury all these people, and there's no more space!"\n\nSimon sighed and looked at Arkady with sad eyes.\n\n"We'll have to take out loans to buy new land and bigger coffins."\n\nArkady responded incredulously, "Father! We're already drowning in debt! Soon, we'll just be giving away our entire church to creditors! Can't we take some money from the parishioners? They'll understand."\n\nSimon sighed again, looked at Arkady, and walked out onto the street with his friend. There was a bench on the street where only priests sat. They sat down, and Simon admired the mountains in the distance. Soon, he continued the conversation:\n\n"Arkady, I know. We're at rock bottom. We have no money. We're living only on donations. Am I blinded to not notice this? But I can't take money for the deaths of these poor people who are being killed by German bombers. For Germans, it's just entertainment, but for us, it's death. Good people are dying! They could have helped this evil world, they could have given that ray of light that we lack. I've heard so many stories about these deaths that tears come to my eyes every time because IT hasn't stopped yet..."\n"Okay, it's your decision. You're the best person I've ever met. And now I have to get back to the service."\nArkady went back to the church to continue the liturgy. Simon, on the other hand, stayed on the street and looked at the majestic Ural Mountains. Suddenly, he began to hear something. When he looked around, he saw a German bomber. Probably looking for his prey. But he noticed one oddity - it was just flying, not throwing bombs. Moreover, it was descending and heading for the mountains. Arkady ran out of the church and saw his friend:\n\n- Run to the church! There's something wrong here, Arkady. After a while, the bomber descended to a dangerous altitude. It could collide with the mountain if it didn't come up. People came out of the church to watch the spectacle. And boom. The bomber's engine exploded, and then it hit the rocky mountain. Smoke appeared that could be seen within a ten-kilometer radius. Simon crossed himself and said to Arkady:\n\n- I need a line to Berezniki."

Finally, he was able to let off steam during this month. The weather was good, a cold breeze blew in his face. Nothing could disturb his relaxation.\n\nSuddenly, police officer Kurchakov burst into his office:\n\n- We have a problem here! A German plane crashed in the northeast. The government demands that we investigate and find out what happened, why it crashed in the Ural Mountains. They entrusted you with all this work!\n\nGrigory looked askance at Kurchakov, sighed heavily, left his coffee on the table, and stood up:\n\n- Oh! Nobody will let me finish my coffee! Assemble the team.\n\nKurchakov saluted Grigory and ran off to gather people to go to the crash site. Grigory also began to gather everything necessary to climb the mountains. The team gathered in 10 minutes. Grigory immediately said to the team:\n\n- Guys, let's do this quickly and get back to headquarters, okay? The coffee will just get cold...\n\nThe truck was ready to go. The team got into the truck, Grigory shouted to the driver to start, and the truck started moving. Grigory was looking at the landscapes passing by the forests, and the team was looking at the smoke appearing in the distance - the crash site. The road ended at a local church. It was from there that the signal about such an incident came. Two priests stood and watched all this time. After questioning them, the team headed towards the mountains.\n\nThey had to overcome the forest, but they passed it in about 20 minutes and reached the foot of the mountains. Although they were not given the opportunity to climb the mountain, they managed to climb it in an hour. It was a good result for "novices." Soon they saw the plane itself. They were lucky that it was a couple of hundred meters away from them. They ran enthusiastically towards it, but when they reached it, they were horrified. People were dismembered: heads, arms, intestines... One of the team members vomited. One exclaimed:\n\n- They certainly deserve to die... but not like this!\n\n\"Who dismembered them? Who killed the entire crew before the explosion? Will we find out or not?" - Grigory asked himself.

Kirill looked around and noticed that all the soldiers were already there, 'But why has everyone gathered?

But today something important is planned. \n\nA man of solid years in everyday clothing with a colored collar, open tunic, and pants, in good boots and a shirt, emerged from the crowd.\n\nHe was clearly an officer in the capital, and he clearly needed to convey something:\n\n'Hello! I am the new colonel of your battalion. My name is Mikhail Andreevich. Your old colonel, namely Yevgeny Goshchin, retired...'\n\n'How could he retire?' the soldiers were surprised, and Yuri added, 'But he was only thirty years old, he couldn't retire!'\n\n'As you can see, he could, I don't know the reasons, but enough of these scenes! I was put here with one single, but big goal, namely to turn you into real soldiers. There's a war coming where you have to die for our country and proudly carry the banner of Mladarossi! And now, fall in!' \n\nIt was after these words that we began to really train. Naturally, the young soldiers didn't like it, but at least Kirill was happy that they were doing something. Kirill was at war. In a terrible war. He also saw its consequences. \n\n'Hey, soldier!' they woke him up from his thoughts, 'Why are we sleeping during training? Clean the rifles! They got so dirty while you were here walking around and drinking our great army away!' Unexpectedly, they threw the Mosin rifle at Kirill, and he dropped it. The colonel snorted, and Kirill stared blankly at the Mosin rifle. Taking a rag and disassembling the rifle itself, Kirill got down to business.

Maxim was born here, in Perm, but the war forced him and his family to move to the USA. There, his work as a doctor became famous all over the world. Many celebrities came to see him from all over the world, and he treated everyone, even Germans who had misbehaved in his homeland. But as sweet as his life abroad was, his heart longed for his homeland. For its vast fields and dense forests. And that's why he decided to return to Perm. But because of certain circumstances (the Aryan Brotherhood), Maxim decided to settle slightly north of Perm, in Berezniki. There, he wanted to build a grand house for his entire family, as well as work for the Russian people who suffered much more than foreigners. And so he hired workers to start building the house 10 km south of Berezniki, near the forest.\n\nBut for his idea of building a house, Maxim was called crazy.

When electricity was first installed, only a few surviving pre-war streetlamps illuminated the roads. Yet prior to this, Gayny had been without electricity for over a dozen years, and for children who had never seen lightbulbs or streetlamps in their lives, electrification seemed nothing short of a divine miracle.

Valera slipped through the onlookers and finally saw the object of public attention with his own eyes: a strange L-shaped metal contraption protruding straight from the ground. Suddenly, a woman approached. She placed a bucket beneath the device and pressed down on its «spout». To Valera's astonishment, water began pouring into the bucket.\n\n—Just imagine!

Standing at the center of the cathedral, he reflected that all this was now his domain. His alone.\n\nYet such self-indulgence bordered dangerously on pride. Sergei tempered his ardor, reminding himself that he ranked first only after God, and must henceforth manifest His will in all things and at all times.\n\nSergei lowered his gaze to the altar. Running his hand over the smooth, gleaming diskos, he took the wine-filled chalice in his other hand. In the crimson liquid, he saw his reflection as in a mirror. It appeared strange to him — neither the grimy tractor driver nor the weary soldier... no, from the goblet stared a bearded man who might already be called elderly. A wave of hubris swept over the Patriarch again — he seemed beyond caring how sinful pride might be. He was God's vicar on earth, legitimate, not self-proclaimed like those pompous, corpulent crown-bearers. His thoughts were interrupted by a telephone ring.

Lifting the receiver, he heard Kazem-Bek's familiar voice:\n\n—Greetings, Mikhail — or rather, Sergei now.\n\n—Greetings, Alexander Lvovich.\n\n—Congratulations.

Your congratulations mean much to me.\n\n—Hm. —Kazem-Bek chuckled briefly. —You undoubtedly realize this yourself, but I must remind you: You've risen remarkably high in remarkably short time. Primarily through your own intellect and judiciousness. Yet in such a position, it's easy to lose perspective and cease evaluating your capabilities soberly.

Black-robed figures flitted among locals - a common sight in regional villages these past months. Dozens of young men settled in sympathetic households, assisting with chores and work.\n\nThrough monastic efforts, even this remote place gained a chapel. Now, on the ruins of the old chapel dynamited by Dirlewanger's men, stood a new church beautiful in its simplicity. Exactly seven days had passed since the monks' midday arrival when the church bell announced this to the village. The monks formed a black line along the main street, bid farewell by all.\n\nThe eldest monk suddenly turned to the people:\n\n- Good people. Our mission is to carry God's will. God loves His children, and we give the desperate and hopeless a chance to remember this. God loves you, and you too can show Him your love. Join the Order of Saint George, and together we shall perform good works.\n\nWhen the monks left the village, their numbers nearly tripled those who had entered."

Their first target of the day would be a Ba'athist agitator, having been spotted and confirmed in location by Tsarist spies a few days ago, his face made sure to have been noted by all the men as they approach their target. Soon deemed clear for entry, Zhirinovsky led his men in, sweeping the lower floor to no avail, before going upstairs to encounter a man laying helplessly behind an open windowsill, his legs certainly having betrayed him in fear.

Having been the new center of Iraq since the Kurdistani government pacifies all it's adversaries, the city has seen massive growth in both capital and visitors in the coming months, adding to the new feel of rush and busyness that is replaces those of other great cities of Iraq, said cities currently going under indefinite reconsctruction. Yet, even within such a bussiness one place stands out more than another, a place now swarmed with all manners of reporters, while protected from all sides by the best bodyguards the nation and money could offer; a place that will nominally be a simple highclass hotel, now the landmark where the fate of Iraq will be charted, a place of civilized negotiation whose values and goals will be uphold in history books throughout all time.\n\nOne by one the players of history appear; Saddam Hussein, the hero of millions, arrives first in his protected limousine. Giving an inspiring speech, the man called for peace and unity not only in Iraq, but through the middle east and the world aswell. "The times of war are behind us, and we must do all we can to not let it stand before us again", he said, to the cheers of crowds and acclaim of observers, giving respect to the crowd before going into the hotel. Next would come notable yet overall faceless people; regional delegates, heads of government, opposing ideologues, and Russian mediators, all of them passing short remarks and giving respects, but none striking as deep as Hussein's.\n\nAnd so it begins, the negotiations. While many would speculate on it's results, no definite information can be verifiably confirmed to have leaked out of the hotel. Some claimed the negotiations fell through, others claim it was salvageable, and yet, when the time finally came, the Mosul Declaration absolutely stunned all, silencing both supporters and oppositions to such a joyous event unfolding; atlast, after so long, people's lifelihoods will be restored, families reunited, and an entire nation under a banner of healing together. The sun seems to shine brighter, and the world seems to stand still in joy, even if only for awhile. Perhaps all those lost lifes will amount to something, afterall."

 MAR_forpol.700.t: "Black Telephone"
 MAR_forpol.700.d: "A table, a chair, a clock, a sheet of paper, and a radio. The bare essentials. Set to the local time of Marseille, the clock ticked in sync with the heartbeat of the MGB communications officer. By the personal order of Belozersky, he was to contact an OAS agent who was now awaiting his call. Call 15 seconds too early or too late—and all prior efforts would go to waste. OAS agents were incredibly paranoid, hence the elaborate codes. Yet Raoul Salan understood that without external support, he would quickly lose.\n\nFinally, as the second hand struck the precise moment, the MGB officer hastily tuned to the correct frequency and waited. A few moments later, the static ceased. From the radio, in a strong French accent, came a seemingly out-of-place question.\n\"Would you like to buy chrysanthemums?\"\n\"For how much?\"\n\"412.132 francs. I recommend buying two.\"\n\nThe connection was abruptly cut—mission accomplished. Contact had been made, and now all that remained was to double the price of the “chrysanthemums” to obtain the coordinates of the channel for continuous communication with Salan’s government."
 MAR_forpol.700.a: "Why did Belozersky choose THEM of all people?!"

 MAR_forpol.701.t: "Loud and Clear"
 MAR_forpol.701.d: "\"Monsieur Salan?\"\n\"Yes, Monsieur Belozersky. I recognized your voice from the time that American journalist interviewed you.\"\n\"I must admit, speaking to you directly over the radio—especially after all the precautions we’ve taken—feels rather unusual.\"\n\"They are no longer necessary. When France’s patriots were fighting against traitors, fools, and bandits, those precautions were a matter of life and death.\"\n\"From Lyon to Bordeaux, OAS control over France is absolute, is it not?\"\n\"The northern regions remain occupied by Himmler, and no one has forgotten Alsace-Lorraine.\"\n\"That’s precisely why I wished to speak with you, Monsieur Salan. You see, we supported your side because you are true patriots of France.\"\n\"And the duty of every French patriot today is to avenge the Pact for decades of humiliation. Trust me, we will uphold our end of the bargain, Monsieur Belozersky.\""
 MAR_forpol.701.a: "\"Excellent. In that case, let’s discuss our future plans.\""

 MAR_forpol.702.t: "Radio Silence"
 MAR_forpol.702.d: "Belozersky’s solitude was offset by the bitter taste of whiskey mixed with tea. As he tried to find the correct radio frequency, he listened intently to every crackle of static and every electronic beep. But it was all in vain. The last time he and Salan had communicated over this channel, Salan had assured him that despite a series of “minor” setbacks on the front, the OAS would still reclaim France from the hands of bandits, fools, and foreign collaborators.\n\nThe irony was that right after those words, the background of Salan’s voice was overtaken by the sounds of gunfire and explosions—then the connection was lost."
 MAR_forpol.702.a: "Another potential ally of Belozersky was lost."

 MAR_forpol.710.t: "Operation 'Sans-culotte'"
 MAR_forpol.710.d: "Gilles' scarred, wrinkled face twisted into an indescribable mix of anger, confusion, and disgust. His gaze was fixed on the order signed by Kosygin to equip and dispatch volunteer divisions to France—specifically, to support Jacques Sauvageot’s revolutionary army. Madness! Gilles had also considered sending troops to France, but not to the revolutionaries—rather, to the OAS. He had plenty of arguments and reasons for Kosygin, but now none of that mattered. Only one thing remained important—would Gilles agree to this? Of course, Kosygin’s will would be carried out, but without Gilles’ signature, it would be significantly delayed. But would that delay mean anything? Yes, it would be a strong gesture of disagreement with Kosygin’s foreign policy—but would it benefit Russia? No, it would not.\n\nWith a heavy sigh, Gilles picked up the pen that had fallen to the floor and signed the order."
 MAR_forpol.710.a: "Gilles could only hope Kosygin knew what he was doing."

 MAR_forpol.711.t: "A Drop of Trust"
 MAR_forpol.711.d: "The red sun scorched Gilles’ bald head. Despite the unusually warm weather that day, Gilles had to be in full ceremonial dress. And for good reason—the Russian liberators of France had returned home from distant Bordeaux. These were the men who had reclaimed not just another ally for Russia, but a socialist state right on the border of the Third Reich. This war was undoubtedly a triumph of Russian arms and diplomacy. Gilles was overjoyed. By trusting Kosygin, he had shed the fears that had plagued him for months. His heart was freed from yet more sins and doubts. After all, what could be better in these dark and volatile times than knowing you have a reliable comrade you can count on? Seeing the first columns of Russian volunteers marching under the crimson flag of the People's Tsardom, Gilles put on his cap and stood at attention."
 MAR_forpol.711.a: "The Russians returned from France victorious. Again!"

 MAR_forpol.712.t: "Unfulfilled Expectations"
 MAR_forpol.712.d: "Heavy rain drummed against Gilles’ cap. Today, he was attending the funeral of an officer who had died in the battles for Clermont. Though he had not known him personally, Gilles knew he had been a brave and capable soldier of Russia. This man could have served Russia for many more years and brought it much good. But now, thanks to Kosygin’s recklessness, he lay in a black coffin.\n\nAnother sin weighed heavily on Gilles’ soul. Though indirectly, he bore some responsibility for the death of this valiant Russian officer. And for what? For a handful of French socialists?! Taking a deep breath, Gilles straightened up and saluted as the coffin was slowly lowered into the ground."
 MAR_forpol.712.a: "Another inner conflict."
