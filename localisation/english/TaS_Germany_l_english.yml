 GER_battle_of_civilizations_desc: "The inevitable has come: defeated peoples have reunited into a single state that, having gathered strength, began its predatory march westward.\n\nOnce before, National Socialist doctrine forged victory by destroying Bolshevism's pseudoutopia with its humanity-corrupting theories. Now comes the decisive confrontation with the Eastern entity – a war that will determine fates: either collapse before a monstrous enemy bringing global catastrophes, or the triumph of the German state asserting its European hegemony while expelling our foes eastward. The Reich shall fortify its borders and reaffirm Nazism's supremacy over other ideas corrupting humanity. This trial will test the singular truth. Its outcome depends on the German people ready to defend themselves in this war..."
 GER_their_bestial_nature_desc: "Decades ago, the Reich brilliantly exposed the essence of peoples from the collapsed USSR's lands. A small catalyst proved sufficient to reveal these creatures' true nature to the world – Untermensch consumed by hatred and destruction toward Aryan blood. Every superior race member was raised rejecting these inferior beings. But this victory proved temporary; the subhuman threat resurges as they delude themselves above their station. In response, we launch a massive propaganda campaign: clear depictions of Russian citizens will reach every Aryan, showcasing humanity's degradation when rejecting true nature."
 GER_collosus_with_feet_of_clay_desc: "Russia, shattered by internal conflicts, attempts unification to restore its former great power status. Yet its current state reveals only decrepitude and fragility – a hovel ready to collapse at a breeze's touch. Russian weakness permeates both foreign policy and national core. External foes arm Russia, but in crisis this support risks proving illusory: Russians will face destiny alone. The key factor remains internal instability – the state balances ethnic separatists, opposition forces, and those still believing in Reich dominance. We must exploit these weaknesses while demonstrating Russia's impotence to match its imagined threat."
 GER_for_our_existence_desc: "Every great achievement carries inevitable sacrifices; only resolute leaders can bear these burdens for supreme goals. Our Reich, tempered by trials and sacrifices, has ascended to reimagine world order. Yet new dangers loom – we wage war against emerging challenges.\n\nNow we must declare general readiness, summoning our people to face hardships with fortitude. All resources shall be mobilized unconditionally for the Fatherland's defense. We must rekindle citizens' spirit of endurance and sacrifice forged in war. 'Everything for victory – nothing against it' shall become our people's immutable creed, followed unwaveringly until triumphant conclusion."
 GER_arbeit_macht_frei_desc: "In these turbulent war times, Europe's productive forces prove inadequate. This demands radical reorientation – full economic mobilization for war. Every citizen, adult or youth, shall serve: tools becoming weapons defining fate and duty to the Fatherland. Factories must operate ceaselessly, daily birthing war machines.\n\nShifts extend to limits, demands multiply mercilessly, work rhythms accelerate relentlessly. This is sacred service, not mere labor. Increased workloads and reduced rest become the norm. Each sweat drop and overtime hour builds the foundation of greatness. Victory's value becomes irrefutable – a testament to Aryan spirit's unyielding resilience against adversity."
 GER_european_brotherhood_desc: "Europe once rediscovered its national roots, rising above illusory 'freedom' and 'equality' to embrace primal essence – its own racial greatness. Purged of pestilent peoples corrupting the Great Germanic Reich's holy order, the continent regained clarity and unity.\n\nLooking backward reveals Nazi efforts' prescience. New threats now endanger hard-won glory. Yet fate smiles: former adversaries stand shoulder-to-shoulder, united in preserving Europe's purity. Mobilization is inevitable – warriors of varied blood but singular purpose shall rise as one. Europe's tongues cry: crush the Eastern menace. Our invincible unity shall again be proven before this common foe."
 GER_united_in_blood_desc: "Death cemented diverse fates into a singular entity on battlefields where all blood merged as one. Through chaos and brutal clashes emerged a brotherhood – an alliance of unyielding warriors sacrificing everything for a supreme cause. Their unity forged indomitable power: each felt comrades' strong hands on their shoulders and saw immortality of ideals reflected in fellow warriors' eyes.\n\nReich's warriors stood as equal pillars of greatness, their resolve symbolizing supreme loyalty to shared blood. This unity embodies not mere resilience but the nation's soul – facing enemies fearlessly. Each warrior becomes a brick in the impregnable fortress, every hammer strike reinforcing its permanence. Here lies invincibility's essence: together they overcome destiny's trials. This cohesion fuels future victories, forming the foundation for historic achievements of an unbending nation."
 GER_gott_mit_uns_desc: "Germans were God's chosen people, entrusted with divine purpose among mortals. Possessing physical fortitude and unparalleled spiritual strength, they overcame trials through faith. This conviction forms modern Germans' self-awareness – faith shaping both inner world and outward conduct.\n\nHow to wield this spiritual might for the Reich? Let every citizen know their earthly deeds echo in divine judgment. By defending the Fatherland, they serve not only the present but shape their eternal destiny. Behind each Aryan stands Almighty God's shadow, filling souls with tireless courage. Belief in chosenness becomes a shield against doubt, transforming existential dread into holy fervor."
 GER_subjugate_the_zeitgeist_desc: "The propaganda machine's reverse gear never tires, yet mere effort proves insufficient. Contemporary rhetoric lacks depth, neglecting history's power to radically reshape public perception of national ideals.\n\nHistory's boundless wisdom demonstrates German greatness since antiquity – triumphs against superior foes. Yet archives conceal inconvenient truths contradicting official narratives. Defeat fades from memory while victories ascend to myth. By weaponizing history, we strengthen ideological control: inspiring through tales of righteous struggle against usurpers, forging unshakable faith in inevitable victory."
 GER_european_volunteers_desc: "The Reich stands not alone against the Russian foe; volunteers flock from every corner of Europe – valiant men ready to defend our ideals. Their choice is no mere gesture: it is a yearning to  join a grand mission. Now is the time to deploy European legions at the front – bolstering defenders' ranks and laying groundwork for joint offensive/defensive operations. Their relentless will shall be victory's keystone, but numbers alone won't suffice.\n\nWe must widen the call – recruiting allies among nations honoring our order and sharing our spirit. Each new comrade-in-arms multiplies triumph's chances. In unity lies invincibility; together we form an unbreakable wall overcoming all obstacles. Let every ally remind us: our shared goal is a victory securing Europe's future – its strength and unity."
 GER_blood_for_the_machine_desc: "Systems decay without users; while heroes hold the front, laborers toil day and night – producing arms and supplying armies. Yet their efforts alone cannot meet strategic demands. Additional forces must be mobilized to accelerate production and ensure seamless frontline provisioning.\n\nThis role falls to Reichskommissariat populations – those seeking better standing. Their aspirations can fuel productivity if harnessed. We must offer illusory prospects: fair labor conditions and upward mobility, however hollow. These mirages will extract maximum contribution to the war effort, binding their hopes to the Reich's survival."
 GER_united_in_purpose_desc: "We rise not just against external foes, but for life's sacred foundation itself. We fight not for hollow promises – every step affirms our right to exist, to uphold ancestral traditions. Each heart must burn with purpose: this is no mere battle, but a sacred duty to ancestors and posterity.\n\nInspiring tales of valor forge steel in our souls. Every soldier must know – their resolve shapes personal and collective destiny! When each warrior becomes a bastion of our cause, sensing kinship with comrades – invincibility becomes our shield. Unity breeds irresistible might. With iron resolve and unshakable faith, we march toward victory. For as one organism, we'll move mountains to preserve our glorious legacy!"
 GER_ultimate_victory_desc: "The inevitable hour has come – heralded by omens of triumph. The majestic Germanic eagle soars heavenward, descending only to rend the Russian bear's carcass that dared challenge its glory. The peace treaty symbolizes submission and historic victory.\n\nNow we proclaim to the world: The Greater Germanic Reich not only weathered war's storm but reaffirmed its unshakable might. Reconstruction begins – fortifying lost positions. The Reich stands majestic, a rock in history's ocean. New horizons open: consolidation becomes triumphant ascension to unprecedented power. The world shall witness our rise – not merely surviving war, but ascending to new heights of greatness."

This is a game of fire and shadow: our army must soberly assess realities to develop strategies preserving territory while creating insurmountable chaos for the enemy."
 GER_graveyard_of_the_empires_desc: "History repeats! RK Moskowien was meant to be Europe's shield against Asian hordes, yet became a bloodsucking leech on the Reich's body. Trillions of Reichsmarks and hundreds of thousands of Aryan lives invested in Moskowien only brought Russian armies to our doorstep!\n\nAfter final victory over the Eurasian Beast, we will identify those responsible for the Reichskommissariat's defensive failures.

 GER_mountains_of_madness_desc: "The Caucasus question eternally haunts Russian politics. This mountainous realm - perpetually seething with passions and contradictions - demands special handling amid escalating tensions. More than a strategic foothold, it's a crossroads of peoples and cultures. We must redirect ethnic grievances against external foes, weaponizing historical resentments. Whatever form this hatred takes, our goal remains: create total chaos across Caucasian slopes and peaks. Within this turmoil lies our chance to strengthen positions through perpetual instability, making control impossible. This turbulence allows manipulation of conflicts in this fractious region."

Inaction risks unconditional enemy occupation. Our paramount mission: act swiftly to neutralize threats and preserve regional stability against looming dangers."
 GER_baltic_citadel_desc: "The Baltic bulwark - cornerstone of our maritime power - now faces collapse and enslavement. This territory controls the Reich's vital arteries; its loss would devastate imperial interests! Immediate action is imperative: launch the Ostland operation with unprecedented resolve. Every delayed day multiplies threats to our dominion.\n\nCommit all resources without reserve; unified efforts shall be our sword and shield against chaos. A coldly calculated plan must become our weapon: fortify positions, restore order - these will decide the struggle's outcome. We shall not yield! Our will shall form an impregnable wall. Defending the Baltic is defending the Reich's heart; every victorious step reaffirms our defiance of fate."

Lord, aid us in this fight."
 GER_dies_irae_desc: "When the war began, it became glaringly obvious that the Reich was riddled with traitors.

 GER_stay_night_desc: "The night of the 20th century has fallen. Degenerate practices of liberalism and communism have poisoned our people’s minds. Slavic subhumans storm our lands, and hope seems lost. No—no, no, and no again! Fate has tested our Volk before, and we will endure this darkest hour. We fight to the last for our people’s future. Though the night is dark, dawn always follows."
 GER_GOTTERDAMMERUNG_desc: "This is the end. Despite the strength of the Aryan spirit, the sanctity and devotion of our people, victory eludes us. Yet we hold one last card: nuclear weapons. They will destroy not just the Slavic hordes but all our enemies. Let the world burn in atomic fire! Let rivers turn to magma, let the ancient forests of Thule be ash. We know a new cycle will follow—one where humanity may yet choose rightly."

 GER_SWRW.22.t: "Farewell"
 GER_SWRW.22.d: "\"No, I won’t let you!\" A child’s shrill cry pierced the quiet of a Silesian village. A girl of ten clung desperately to her older brother’s leg. He wore a gray uniform, a bag slung over his shoulder.\n\n—Hush now. Why the tears? — Hans knelt and gently stroked his sister’s head. Her long red hair still felt soft, still as unruly as ever.\n\n—I won’t let you go! Hear me!? — She screamed through tears. Erika wasn’t foolish. She didn’t know where he was going, but she knew it meant nothing good.\n\n—Calm yourself. — He hugged her tightly.\n\n—No one... no one comes back. Papa didn’t. Uncle Alan didn’t. They all wore that uniform. And now... now— Her small body trembled.\n\n—The war just isn’t over yet. They’re still fighting. — He wiped her cheek. — So we can live in peace.

 #Ивенты Войны Германии
 GER_SWRW.1.t: "A Show for the Boisterous Crowd"
 GER_SWRW.1.d: "A mass of citizens gathered on the streets of a German city: shoulder to shoulder they stood along the sidewalks, and the windows of houses turned into viewing balconies to watch the demonstration the Reich declared a 'parade of triumph.' But instead of the expected gleaming military columns and marching soldiers, the roads saw a procession of a completely different nature — emaciated Russian prisoners of war.\n\nAmidst the furious shouts of the crowd, full of hateful jeers and insults, the prisoners trudged forward with difficulty, many barely able to stand from exhaustion. Their faces were smeared with dirt, their bodies so thin that every bone was visible beneath their skin; their uniforms hung in tatters. Guards pushed them along with rifle butts and sharp commands.\n\nThe crowd, fired up by propaganda speeches, knew no bounds in its aggression: rotten vegetables, trash, and even stones rained down on the prisoners; people spat at their feet and hurled false accusations. Children echoed the adults’ insults, while the elderly turned away in contempt, calling the prisoners 'eastern barbarians.'\n\nFor the Russian soldiers, this path was not only physical torment for their battered bodies; each step and every humiliation deeply wounded their souls. In every shout echoed the distant call of home, and in every spit, the crushing realization of their hopelessness. Yet among the doomed, some clung to remnants of human dignity: one prisoner, mustering his last strength, straightened up and gazed at the crowd with quiet defiance — his face twisted in pain, but his eyes gleamed with unbroken pride.\n\nFor the German people, this procession was yet another affirmation of their greatness; for the prisoners — a grim reminder of war’s ruthlessness and a harbinger of trials yet to come."

 GER_SWRW.2.t: "To the Symphony of Machines"
 GER_SWRW.2.d: "Once again, the gray pre-dawn hour arrived: the night shift completed their long toil, making way for those doomed to work tirelessly until the next twilight... German workers were now a rare sight. The majority of the workforce consisted of Ukrainians, people from Ostland, and even a small group of Caucasians — all driven here by one goal: to earn a living at any cost.\n\nPrestigious positions were long gone; the workers had sold their freedom for meager wages, which still surpassed the destitution they faced back home. Today differed little from the last: assembly lines endlessly churned out streams of the latest weaponry bound for the front.\n\nAmidst this strict rhythm and constant supervision, the workers retained their humanity. Between machines, fragments of conversation echoed:\n\n— How’d you end up here? — one asked his neighbor on the assembly line.\n\n— Same as everyone else: came to scrape together some money. But ended up in this mess... Feels like I’ll die working here! — replied the other without looking up from assembling parts.\n\n— At least there’s some future ahead... — sighed the first, thoughtfully watching the stream of weapons. — The war’ll end eventually, maybe working conditions will improve.\n\n— You’re an optimist! Who knows if we’ll ever be seen as anything among these proud Aryans. And no time for chatting — we’ve got quotas. You know what happens if we don’t meet them. — the second shot back sharply, though without real malice.\n\n— Yeah, yeah... — the first agreed, returning to his work. Silence reclaimed the workshop, broken only by the rhythmic hammering, the grinding of machines, and the clicks of mechanisms — an endless symphony of relentless production."

 GER_SWRW.3.d: "Times and eras intertwine with relics of the past — artifacts that survive decades and centuries, becoming mirrors of history. Karl, a humble museum worker on Germany’s outskirts, knew this better than anyone.\n\nAs a tour guide, his tales of the Reich’s glory resonated with special pride. Every old map in Karl’s hands came alive under his voice: from the first steps of the German state to the peak of the Greater German Reich... In every period of history, he found reasons for national pride, as if unveiling the hidden pages of greatness.\n\nBut the world had changed. Karl’s tours now carried a new tone: Germany, he claimed, was a tale of continuous rise and overcoming obstacles, while Russia, in contrast, repeatedly collapsed into crises after its ambitious conquests, unable to handle them. In every story, he painted a picture of unmatched development: while Germany soared to the heights of the Reich’s greatness, its eastern neighbor only grew weaker and faced defeat.\n\nWith passion bordering on fanaticism, Karl highlighted Russia’s historical 'failures' — two wars for world dominance ended in its downfall. His belief in the inevitable new triumph of the Greater German Reich was unshakable; every visitor who came to learn about the complex relationship between the two empires left his tours contemplating the historical inevitability of German supremacy.\n\nHis unwavering faith in his country’s infallibility and eternal greatness fueled Karl’s stories.

Another group of soldiers sat inside, heading to the Eastern Front, which demanded special attention and care. The crew sat mostly in silence, mentally preparing for battle; yet even in such a strained atmosphere, they found a moment to speak.\n\n— You know, my father was on the Eastern Front during the last big war... — an eager Spaniard began in broken German. His command of the language was far from perfect, but he was still understandable. His comrades turned to him, surprised by the unexpected confession. — He was part of a volunteer division and made quite a name for himself. And now, here I am, heading into this new war.\n\n— So, you’re following in your father’s footsteps? — asked one of the younger Germans.\n\n— Pretty much... He’s always been my role model; he fought for Europe against the Russians, protecting it. Now I want to show that he raised a worthy successor. It’s my turn to feel the blood-soaked fields of battle.\n\nThe Germans burst into laughter, those seated nearby giving him hearty slaps on the back, exclaiming, 'Worthy! Worthy!' — their way of supporting their foreign comrade. But a sudden jolt from the armored vehicle cut the conversation short, forcing everyone back into focus: some checked their weapons, others scanned the surroundings, while a few simply sat still. Finally, the Spaniard concluded:\n\n— May this war make us worthy sons of the Fatherland..."

Televisions and radios buzz non-stop, every channel and station broadcasting news of the nation’s heroic feat.\n\nThe rising sun illuminates the lands of the Greater German Reich — this grand victory stands as a brilliant testament to the unshakable ideals, proving their real power to the world. In brutal battles, German forces not only defended their homeland but struck a crushing blow to the enemy, forcing them to bow to defeat.\n\nIt is now time to steer the state’s chariot back toward stability and peace — following trials that demanded immense sacrifice.

If we can't protect all these vast expanses from the Dnieper to the Volga with high quality, then why not focus on ensuring that nothing valuable gets to the enemy.

The second strategy, proposed by the command of the SS divisions, involves using scorched earth tactics on the territories under our control.

Therefore, I ask you to stand once more under the banner of the German people to fight against the Russian threat.

In past years, such unrest could have been handled by the SS or the reserve army, but the scale of the war has forced nearly all armed formations of the Reich to be redeployed to the front.\n\nFor this reason, the issue raised in an official letter from the Reichsminister of Ukraine has become particularly urgent and critical for Germany’s top military and political officials. In his report to the Führer, the Reichsminister of Ukraine states that most leaders of nationalist armed groups, whether the newly formed OUN-UPA or the SS Division 'Galicia,' are submitting petitions for expanded authority in both the army and local administrations due to the \"threat of Russian occupation of Ukraine.\" While the Ukrainian nationalists voice vague goals, their ulterior motive is clear—\"either you give us more power, or we start fighting against you.\" In other times, such petitions would have led to the immediate arrest of the leaders and the liquidation of these armed groups, but due to the threat of a complete collapse of the front, the Führer sees no other choice."

He was a simple soldier from the Black Sea port garrison, so the massive vessel, painted dark gray with a huge eagle on its starboard side, amazed him, even if it was just an oil tanker. Another evening patrol in the port, another aimless walk, with hardly anyone to talk to.\n\n\"Still, this is better than the eastern front,\" he thought in such moments. The soldier glanced at the tanker and approached the ladder leading to it. One step, another, a third... and Michael was aboard. He had taken only a couple of tentative steps across the deck when a chorus of shouting voices erupted behind him.\n\nThe man turned around. A dozen small figures stood in the distance, yelling furiously and waving their arms. Their voices overlapped, making it hard to discern anything. Michael was about to wave back when he made out two words that stood out above the rest: \"Run!\" and \"Jump!\" With horror, he turned back toward the deck. Oh God... The deck beneath him erupted in a crimson-orange blast.\n\nPain—the only coherent thought pounded in his brain when he came to. The explosion must have thrown him far. Opening one eye, Michael thought the world had turned yellow and orange, but it was fire... just fire. His right eye saw nothing at all, and his left was partially covered in blood. Finding strength from some unknown source, he rolled over and crawled along the shore. It seemed everything was burning: the ships, the port, the surrounding buildings, even the water. But that didn’t matter. He would survive... he had to. The shore was full of rocks, each one scraping his body as he moved over it. But his entire body ached already—what difference did it make?\n\nAnother meter behind him. Just a little more, and he’d make it out. He’d make it out and go home. Cursing in a quiet, hoarse voice, Michael tried to stand. No luck. He didn’t even have the strength to lift his body. Rolling over, Michael looked at the moon, then shifted his gaze to his legs. To where his legs should have been. He stared blankly at the spot, and only after a dozen seconds did he realize his legs were gone—just two bleeding stumps covered in charred crust. Michael turned his gaze back to the moon.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" he murmured."

Some tried to organize protests against this \"policy\" of the German military, only to be suppressed once again, humiliated, and the most defiant—killed. Others chose a more radical and effective path of resistance—joining, or in some cases forming, pro-Russian militias. But just as since the full occupation of Ukraine by the Germans, the sentiments of the native population mattered little to the Nazi administration."

Using his ties within the NSDAP, industry, and even Speer’s inner circle, Abs ousted the Führer and seized power.\n\nNow, with no slaves, no economy, no army, and no stability left, Abs holds the reins.

During the First West Russian War, he was a key advisor to Hitler on Reich defense. Later, he was forced into retirement — and as fate would have it, that war was lost.

 POSTWRW2_JAN_LIPSKY_DESC: "Poland will live forever. This is the idea Jan Józef carried in his heart through the 20th century. When the Germans occupied his homeland, he did not surrender—his family helped hide Jews from the regime, and he himself joined the resistance.\n\nOver his life, he fought in countless partisan organizations, including the Home Army, but with each new defeat, he was forced to join ever-newer resistance groups. Yet the executioners could not claim his soul.\n\nAs soon as Russian forces entered Poland, he knew it was time to act. Warsaw blazed anew, and the Germans fled Polish soil. Ultimately, Józef embodied the perfect compromise between the interests of the People’s Army and the Home Army, so Moscow did not hesitate long before appointing him Poland’s leader. And Jan Józef accepted this with joy.\n\nFor Poland is not yet lost."

 POSTWRW2_Sabbat_Kazimierz_DESC: "'The state is a rational unfreedom, which Poles will never accept... If I were to predict what nations will do in the next century, beside the word "Poland" I would write "rebels."' — Alexander II\n\nKazimierz Sabbat was born on the eve of the Great War. His life split into two eras: before World War II and after. Before the war, he studied law at the University of Warsaw and promoted the scout movement among youth. Afterward, peaceful life became a memory.\n\nDuring Poland’s defeat in World War II, Kazimierz was wounded. Plans to evacuate him to England were foiled only by a delayed message—a twist of fate that saved his life. Though he remained in occupied Poland, Kazimierz, like millions of Poles, awaited one thing: liberation. Through the Polish Underground State’s operations, he became a leading figure of Polish liberalism.\n\nWith Russia’s liberation of Poland began a new chapter—both for Sabbat and the Polish state. Centuries of mutual enmity gave way to cooperation. Sabbat dedicated himself to rebuilding Poland, slowly but surely restoring it physically and spiritually.\n\nPoland has not yet risen from the ashes, as Poles once dreamed. The Polish phoenix still awaits its flight!"

He joined the Polish Army immediately after World War I, he enshrined the Polish administration in Vilnius. But in 1939 his world was shattered. He became a fighter, he became a member of the Krajowa Army.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded London, he had no choice but to flee. He found his new home in New York, but even there his faith in his homeland did not fade. Finally, in the '50s, the Russians struck in Germany, revealing the Achilles' heel of that colossus - partisan movements. Together with the Krajowa Army, Muzyczka left for his homeland, where he set up the "Shadow State". Fortunately, the new German regime had no time to destroy its prisoners. Muzyczka held on, withstanding blow after blow. And then the Russians came, and all hell broke loose. Poland returned as free as ever, and Muzyczka was given a new role, so similar to the one that fell to him after World War I: the return of Silesia to its native Polish Harbor.nIn this time Muzyczka will not allow a repeat of the Polish Tragedy."

Officially, Freikorps swiftly rescued him. In truth, the RAF captured him to exploit his royal prestige, spreading radical leftist ideas among Germans. Death threats against him and his wife forced compliance.\n\nFor years, they meticulously cultivated doubt and sympathy for revolutionary terrorists through Louis. His popularity let the RAF propagate their rhetoric nationwide, particularly in Prussia. Despite traditional conservatism, Louis captivated mainstream traditionalists – reshaping worldviews of even staunch reactionaries.\n\nThe Eastern War's end revived old ideologies, including monarchism. Louis rebranded as a 'Social Monarchist' – champion of the downtrodden. Simultaneously, the RAF infiltrated daily life, politics, military, and economy. Daily, they demand more from the People's Prince – laying groundwork for Marxism-Leninism.\n\nThe day approaches when only the prince's name remains... and the people raise blood-red banners..."

It can only be viewed through the prism of one’s perception, and Vladimir finds it agonizing to glance backward. Yet history tolerates no subjunctive mood. Gil could have become a posthumous martyr and hero of the Union. Rodion – a pawn of some Tambov-based corporation. Vladimir – a liberator-hero of the Soviet Union. None of this came to pass.\n\nWhat matters now is that the reborn Russian Empire’s army general holds all of Central Europe in his hands. Red partisans, Werewolves, collapsing infrastructure – these are but fragments of the challenges. Yet Gil has sworn an oath: he will see this through to the end. As long as this task remains his charge, Germany shall never rise again."

Thanks to his social-democratic convictions and work with the population, he gained wide support among workers and intellectuals, becoming the face of the Social Democratic Party of Denmark in the underground.\n\nAfter the end of the Second West Russian War, Anker got the opportunity to become the Prime Minister of Denmark. There was still much to return and change, and now a tough approach to the economy is required, which over the previous decades had become an appendage to Germany. Nevertheless, Denmark can sleep peacefully, knowing that Anker Jørgensen is lulling it to sleep."

He may not have been the best option for the Rhine, but he knew how to present himself correctly."

 POSTWRW2_Willy_Brandt_DESC: "Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm, the future Willy Brandt, was born in the free city of Lübeck. As a young man, he stepped onto the political path when in 1930 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), and later the Socialist Party of Germany. The rise of the Nazis to power marked for Frahm both the end of his legal activities and the beginning of his anti-fascist struggle, which lasted for decades.\n\nFor a significant time, he was involved in supporting the intelligence services of the Allies, organizing speeches by political emigrants from Europe while in Sweden. As a Scandinavian correspondent, he tried to cover Germany's crimes throughout Europe, but soon this ceased to bear fruit. In the mid-1940s, he rejoined the SPD and later engaged in promoting anti-fascist sentiments among German students, where there was a particular response in the territory of West Germany. Shortly before the hostilities in the East, he moved to the territory of the Reich to more compactly establish connections between various anti-fascist organizations.\n\nAfter the end of the Second West Russian War, the territory of the Rhineland was separated from the main part of Germany, and a mad struggle for power began. However, unlike other territories of the former Germany, honest democratic elections were held here, the first in a long time, as a result of which the first president became the youth favorite Willy Brandt.\n\nWilly Brandt's task is simple and clear - to make the Rhineland the most worthy place on the corpse of Germany. The policy of denazification, democratization of society, and establishment of international relations, attracting investments - this is just the beginning of the Federation. The post-war society, apathetically inclined, has yet to taste the fruits of democracy, which were taken away from them since the days of the Weimar Republic, whose legacy will become the foundation for the New Heart of Germany."
 
 POSTWRW2_Gunter_Guillaume_DESC: "Gunther Guillaume, a loyal colleague and ally of the deceased Willy Brandt, took the place of his predecessor, taking over new powers. However, despite the trust of the deceased, many are watching the new ruler with suspicion, noticing more and more strange details about him.\n\nThe closeness, the almost empty biography, the complete immersion in the endless work – absolutely everything served as a reason for suspicion of Guillaume's incomprehensible personality. Many people involuntarily wonder: What is Gunther Guillaume really like? Is his thoughts so pure, being the heir to the Brandt business?\n\nHowever, these suspicions are not far from the truth. Gunther Guillaume, at the beginning of his life, was an ordinary man who did not represent anything special. However, this changed soon enough after he joined the ORPO. As it turned out, Guillaume had a natural talent for implementation, which undoubtedly served as a benefit for the organization he worked for.\n\nHaving long been sent as a secret observer from the ORPO, Gunther did everything necessary to build connections at the highest level, including with Willy Brandt. What ultimately turned out to be a success for the ORPO: Gunther Guillaume, their agent, gained power, which undoubtedly freed their hands in the future."

However, staying in one place for long after the fall of the Netherlands was not possible, and when the Japanese invaded Indonesia, she had to flee again. Australia, Brazil, Canada, Suriname, this eternal escape was exhausting, and when it seemed there was no chance to return, a miracle happened.\n\nTsar Belozersky personally sent a letter to Juliana with an offer to return. God knows what made him do it. It was either an attempt to imitate old diplomatic assessments or such a manifestation of solidarity between exiled monarchs.\n\nHowever, upon returning, the queen realized that everything was not so rosy: her Homeland was destroyed by wars, people had lost hope due to cruel repressions. A fairly logical outcome, a broken queen for a broken nation."

 POSTWRW2_Willy_Claes_DESC: "The Netherlands is a place of the destitute. The war took tens of thousands of lives irrevocably lost, hundreds of thousands were left without shelter, but it was not better ahead. The Germanization of Luxembourg, the ban on cultural and scientific activities in the Netherlands and Belgium, the pitting of Flemings and Walloons against each other - just small episodes of the consequences brought by the Reich. The population was apathetic to its fate, trying to get used to the new realities.\n\nYet, the flame of nationalism and love of freedom did not go out in the Benelux. The countryside supported partisans with food and shelter, and the city tirelessly spread ideas of freedom and independence. Only recently was a single organization 'Forces Bénélux de l'intérieur' / 'Benelux Strijdkrachten van Binnenlandse Zaken' (FBI), the Internal Forces of the Netherlands, created, which united disparate regional formations. The role of Willem Claes, who became the ideological inspirer and political face of the organization, was significant. Having received enough trust and recognition from the population, the organization struck the occupiers during the new war in the East.\n\nWith the permission of the victors, the FBI became the dominant organization in the territory of the Netherlands. But problems haunt the unified region here too - from administrative and legislative to political and ideological. The country is torn apart by nationalist and socialist elements. Nevertheless, as long as the Federation of the Netherlands is ruled by Willem Claes, the future of Luxembourg, Belgium, Holland, and Friesland is bright and full of hope."

The most tangible sign of its presence is the four key megacorporations: IG Farben, Daimler-Benz, Siemens, and Reichswerke Hermann Göring. It was the latter corporation that became home to Ferdinand Porsche's unremarkable company 'Volkswagen' after a series of manipulations and forgeries typical for the Reich. Only the fall of the Reich was able to wrest the automobile factories from the hands of this bloated rotting corpse. Now Volkswagen is a symbol of the new German corporation for the new free Germany, the face of Westphalia to the whole world."

The seed, first sown when Napoleon brought the ideas of the Great French Revolution to German lands, sprouted in the chaos of the 1848 Revolution. Then the sprout rotted under the authoritarian rule of the Prussians, and it seemed that the Weimar Republic would allow it to flourish. Unfortunately, in the Berlin corridors, they decided otherwise, and the regime of Adolf Hitler concreted the dream of a free Germany. However, a living tree is not so easy to kill. The Nazis fell, and now Westphalia is governed by 3 D's: Denazification, Democratization, and Demilitarization. At the moment, Westphalia is the only functioning democracy in Germany, with all its pros and cons."

All his conscious life, he considered himself a communist: a diligent student of the Leninist school, he first saw the greatness of the Soviet Union and then learned of its terrible demise.\n\nReturning to his Homeland, he joined the anti-fascist movement and soon ended up in Brandenburg Prison, where he remained until the 1950s. The SS rebellion allowed him to escape and join the Red Army. Although his views did not always align with Meinhof's ideas, on the other hand, they were still better than the Nazis.\n\nAnd when the Russians came, Waldemar realized that this was his chance to fix everything. With members of the Red Army and rebel anti-fascists, he managed to establish control over Hanover and contact the government of the Empire. Although his hands are now somewhat tied, he is full of strength and ready to punish the fascists for all they have done."

In the end, such is the nature of the Germans. However, just a little time later, Roman Civilization broke the barbaric spirit of these people, turning them into the French: connoisseurs of art, culture, free-thinking, and independent people. But many Germanic tribes remained outside the Roman orbit. This led to the emergence of Germanic peoples, and then Germany: a monster state that tore apart everything it touched.\n\nThe Czech state and its great leader managed to tame the German beast, but for how long? To never be slaves again, the Czechs will have to do what Rome once did with the Franks: turn barbarians into civilized people. However, why reinvent the wheel when French culture already exists?\n\nThe members of the Integration Committee of Allemannia have prepared a program to destroy the barbaric German culture, the barbaric German language, and the German identity itself, and then replace them with the superior French culture, French language, and a new Allemannic identity that respects those who freed them from the shackles of barbarism."

Germany became the beginning of the infection of the whole world with the cancer of extremist misanthropic ideologies, Germany almost destroyed the peoples of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, France.

The first state formation of the Slavs was deceived by the Germans, who promised protection in exchange for a vassal oath. As a result, the legacy of Carantania was forgotten, and the Germans continued to Germanize the lands of the Slavs and not only.\n\nNow Czechia has a chance to revive this state just as they revived theirs. From the ashes of time, a new strong state will rise, a friend and ally. To do this, it will be necessary to reverse the process of Germanization.

Now the cornerstone of our policy has become revenge: revenge for all that we have experienced.\n\nAlois Grebenicek - one of the few who survived all this horror, and now the head of the young Czech State, announced 'actions to restore statehood and the nation.' Under the euphonious name lie the most diverse persecutions of Germans, even those who have lived on its territory for hundreds of years.

 POSTWRW2_Alois_Grebenicek_DESC: "The life of Alois, like the life of any Czech, can be described in two words - shame and betrayal.\n\nThe son of a butcher, Alois always wanted to have his father's profession, and even received it, but with the arrival of the Germans, everything changed. They destroyed his culture, language, and all Czech heritage. He could not tolerate this - so he soon joined the Resistance movement, which almost managed to kill the scoundrel in Czechia - Reinhard Heydrich. However, he managed to stay alive, after which mass purges took place throughout Czechia, as a result of which most of the Resistance members died or ended up in death camps, where Alois was also sent. Having gone through many tortures, he did not give up, but on the contrary - promised himself that he would definitely take revenge on the German bastards.\n\nBy the will of fate, he did not perish in the camps, but was sent to Weimar to the factories, where there were many others like him. Alois was preparing for an escape, and only after 10 years, with the beginning of the civil war in Germany, he, along with several other people, managed to escape. A few days after that, he was able to return to his native lands, where little reminded him of the times before the war. There he organized a partisan detachment, which acted as cautiously as possible, waiting for when it would be possible to strike the last blow to his enemy.\nMany more years passed before they began to act. Having heard about the new war with the Russians, as well as their victories, he began terrorist acts throughout Czechia, and when the Russian flag flew over Berlin, he was able to negotiate that the management of Czechia would be granted to him.\nAlois has experienced a lot in his life, as has his people, but now he will do everything possible to restore his country, and also that not a single German leaves the borders of Czechia on his own feet.\n\n§RThe time for revenge has come§!."

 POSTWRW2_Alexander_Dubcek_DESC: "Dubcek's childhood cannot be called happy. At the age of four, he moved with his family to the Kyrgyz commune, from where he later moved to Gorky. The youth spent in the Soviet Union taught him love for socialism, hard work, and readiness for any difficulties.\n\nReturning to his homeland in 1938, a year later he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. After the invasion of German troops and the proclamation of the Slovak Republic, he participated in the anti-fascist movement, maintained contacts with underground workers. Later, he organized a large socialist anti-government movement throughout Slovakia. He did not forget about supporting the Czech resistance, which, however, suffered defeat after defeat due to stronger pressure from Germany.\n\nThe political turning point occurred during the war between the revived Russia and Germany. All of Slovakia rose up against the Tiso regime, and at the head of this nationwide movement was Dubcek himself. Already after the proclamation of the Slovak Socialist Republic, and later the revival of Czechoslovakia, Dubcek faced an unplowed field. Hunger, poverty, destroyed industry on one side met with cultural squabbles and ideological confrontation on the other. The country had to decide the fate of the German heritage, the Germans themselves, and their influence on the two brotherly peoples - Czechs and Slovaks. Political unity was also important, which Dubcek had been striving for all these long years only on the territory of Slovakia.\n\nAnd although the present is not viewed with optimism, everyone understands only one thing - the future of Czechoslovakia lies in freedom. Only through the hard work of workers and peasants, teachers and ordinary people will Czechoslovakia have the future for which they stood to the last all these years."

He will never forget Sachsenhausen.\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, Franz lost his father: Albrecht died during the construction of Germania, the new capital of the world, and his son remembered this well. Then he, a descendant of a very respected family, was made a slave and forced to work in a factory in Bavaria.\n\nHowever, justice prevailed. As soon as the Reich's regime began to collapse, Franz raised an uprising that was able to occupy most of Bavaria. And, of course, he was the ideal candidate for the Russian government.

 POSTWRW2_Egon_Krenz_DESC: "The story of Egon Krenz is unique. Coming from a simple family in a world where socialism failed, he was still devoted to the ideals of Marx, Engels, and Lenin to the bitter end. At first, his life was ordinary and simple. However, while still a student, he began to be impressed by rumors of actions by left-radical organizations. Later, he fell into the circle of socialist-revolutionaries, where he adopted new beliefs.\n\nOver the years of active socialist underground activity, Krenz saw a lot, from organizing spontaneous actions, strikes, to punitive events, which he had previously read about and now committed himself. Time passed, but the revolution never came. German left-radical groups cut each other's throats in the hope that their ideas were correct and true. They fought for media attention, committing increasingly brutal actions, thereby losing support among the population. It seemed that only Krenz understood this. It was then that he decided to revise his views.\n\nEgon Krenz's theory is that to build socialism in Germany, it is necessary to adopt market elements and capitalism. It did not find wide support among revolutionaries, but the common people liked these ideas. Gradually, the number of supporters grew, and soon the movement became organized. It was not going to lose its radicalism, although it did not resort to terrorism. Egon Krenz's organization collected weapons from all over the country, preparing for a convenient moment for revolution.\n\nGermany's defeat left the lands of Bavaria destitute and poor. It was on this that Krenz focused. Taking power into his hands, he set about building his Socialist Bavaria, which combines the best features of capitalism and socialism. With a firm hand, he will rule this land, and only he alone knows the fate of the new Bavarian republic.\n\nOnly occasionally, on a dark night, Egon Krenz wakes up in a cold sweat, remembering the tortured victims he sacrificed for the glory of the revolution. They must not be in vain..."

Most of the industry was destroyed as a result of the war with the Russians, many people were left homeless, and the Nazis, who did not come to terms with the defeat in the war, continue to attack Russian garrisons and police stations. So Austria is entering a period when, under the firm hand of its king, it must pass through the approaching storm like a ship."

From a young age, struck by the post-war state and the level of poverty in Austria, Bruno joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria at the age of fifteen. Later, in 1929, a meeting and then studying at the University of Vienna under Otto Bauer played a decisive role in Bruno's future life.\n\nFrom the day the SDAP was banned, a dark streak began in Krajsky's life. First, he was arrested on charges of high treason. The relatively mild sentence was compensated by the Anschluss, when Bruno almost ended up in Dachau, but due to a fortunate coincidence, after six months of imprisonment and subsequent release, he emigrated to Sweden.\n\nWhile Europe was plunging into shadow, Krajsky was engaged in journalism. The experience of Swedish democratic socialism ignited hope in Bruno for a return to his Homeland. It was under its influence that Krajsky Bruno developed the so-called concept of the 'Austrian path to democratic socialism,' becoming the main figure of this movement, which spread among the Austrian political emigration.\n\nThe liberation of Austria and the opportunity provided by the Russian government to recreate the state made it possible to apply the theory in practice. Decades of asceticism, poverty, and post-war destruction, as if it were that old Austria, became the ground for political transformations. And although Austria faces a long path of recovery, the alliance of democracy and socialism will become a solid foundation for the future of the Danubian republic."

At one time, he even highlighted the interesting ideology of the Young Russians. Nevertheless, he always came out 'dry from the water.'\n\nWhen the German Empire began to crack, the inhabitants of Norway felt the wind of freedom. Russian troops were clearly not going to stay here for long, and Finn got the country into his hands. Now he will do everything to turn Norway into an honest state where all people are equal.

And the decision eventually brought the Germans down from heaven to earth.\n\nMost of the once great Germany is occupied; useless local tsars, representatives of subhumans, and henchmen of the red tsar have divided the ravaged nation among themselves.\n\nBut this cannot last long; the spirit of revenge of the German people has awakened, and the faithful sons of the fatherland have risen to return the land of their fathers to themselves. And not only it, all former enemies will know anger; like a pack of wolves, they will drive the enemies and will not rest until the German flag flies over the whole world.\n\nOr they will die trying."

The Czechs consider this 'restoration of supreme justice,' but for us, it is only suffering and deprivation.\n\nEach member of the Sudeten Front has lost someone or something. From now on, we are in a struggle for our lives, and there are only two ways left - to restore order in Bohemia or die at the hands of wretched bandits."

Being a hero of propaganda, he starred in war films, gave interviews, and even wrote books.\n\nBut all his life, he was tormented by the question of how much he deserved his title and whether it was worth being proud of at all. However, this could be forgotten while Germany cared for its ace. An estate in the Sudetes and a large number of slaves helped to drown out the torment from within.\n\nBut recently, something happened that he could not tolerate. After the fall of the Reich, the Sudeten lands were transferred to the mad Czechs, who immediately began mass evictions and executions. And now all of West Germany is engulfed in flames, while the Russian garrison has lost control over this territory.\n\nHe may not consider himself a hero, but he must become one. For himself, for the people who followed him. For Germany."

However, from now on, papers had become the field marshal’s main enemy. Even taking a bullet from the Werewolves wasn’t as terrifying as being buried under a pile of documents.\n\nOutside the window of the temporary headquarters, shouts constantly rang out; someone even threw stones at the guards, but they were quickly dispersed. But today was a special day. The decree on denazification, signed a week ago, was coming into effect, and the leader of the German Administration of Occupied Territories had to personally attend the event.\n\nGil pulled on his jacket and stepped outside. The former capital of Germany now looked far less welcoming than usual, but that no longer mattered.\n\nVladimir got into the back seat of the car, and the German vehicle set off.

The majestic building was noticeably battered; artillery and air raids had breached the roof in several places, and the eagle, once towering at the top, now lay broken near the entrance. Yet, even in this state, the building still inspired a certain sense of awe.\n\n“They sure knew something about architecture,” Gil thought to himself. Soon, he approached the area where the main spectacle was to take place, where, at a safe distance, all sorts of journalists, photographers, and curious onlookers had gathered to witness the end of the grand structure. Security, of course, didn’t allow everyone too close. But even the sight of so many journalists made Gil feel nauseous.\n\nAs soon as he appeared, a young woman with a cameraman approached him. The camera bore some hieroglyphs that Gil couldn’t even read, let alone understand. “Greetings, dear viewers, standing before us is Vladimir Gil, leader of the German Administration of Occupied Territories, and right now, the so-called denazification decree is coming into effect. One of its points is the demolition of the so-called ‘Hall of the People.’ Would you like to add anything to this?” the young presenter from a state TV channel rattled off, shoving a microphone in Vladimir’s face.\n\nGil leaned down slightly and began speaking: “Yes, today, as part of denazification, the Volkshalle will be demolished, after which denazification will begin in full force. It will cover all monuments of the Nazi era, mentions of Nazis, and especially the previous Führer in the names of institutions, streets, and other objects. Trials will also be held for Nazi collaborators and NSDAP members. Historical injustice will be corrected.” He then smiled and headed toward the demolition crew.\n\nThey were already waiting in position, surrounded by numerous pieces of equipment and journalists from both Russian and foreign agencies. The demolition commander approached Gil, saluted, and said, “The sappers have carried out the order and await further instructions!” Vladimir theatrically took a few steps forward, raised his right hand, and began the countdown: “On my command! One! Two! Three!”—then waved his hand.\n\nMultiple explosive devices detonated simultaneously, collapsing the building’s load-bearing components, and it crumbled like a sandcastle.

A particularly angry protester broke out of the crowd and charged toward Vladimir’s car. Bullets quickly struck him down; he didn’t get far.\n\nBut as soon as he fell, an explosion went off. It was far enough from the cars themselves but caught the soldiers holding back the crowd and a few civilians. Soon, shots rang out from windows and directly from the crowd.

The old man carefully set down the buckets, tried to straighten up, and reach for them again when he caught the gaze of a Russian soldier. He was looking at the old man with some confusion.\n\nHans immediately took a few steps back—this clearly didn’t bode well. He’d already heard stories about what soldiers did to civilians: robbing, killing for fun. He’d heard they were avenging the war in Russia, but that war had ended long ago!\n\nSuddenly, the soldier broke the silence: “Need help?” the young man asked. Hans didn’t understand; he didn’t know Russian, and the soldier, apparently, didn’t know German. The old man pointed to his ears—probably not the best way to say he didn’t understand, but he couldn’t think of anything else at the moment.\n\nThe soldier silently picked up the buckets and gave a questioning nod. The old man stood still for a moment before pointing with his hand. The young man walked in that direction without a word, and the old man shuffled after him. Then it hit him—something wasn’t right. This kid didn’t look at all like the Mongoloid invaders the propaganda had painted them as. His head started throbbing.\n\nHans even felt a pang of sadness.

The only correct solution to this problem is the encouragement of Czech culture, people, and traditions. Thus, the decrees... "On the Protection of Czech Culture," "On the Preservation of Czech Nationality," and "On the Restoration of Czech Traditions" will soon come into effect.' \n\nBut we must remember and not forget that all these misfortunes were brought to the Czech people by the GERMAN PEOPLE! It was because of the Germans that the treacherous Munich Agreement was made, it was because of the Germans that our Homeland became a slave for 30 long, agonizing years. They are the root of our problems. Therefore, I am obliged to enforce the decree 'On the Creation of National Security Battalions.' These formations have the authority to evict and relocate Germans from their homes to special camps located outside the cities. When encountering them while they are performing their state duty, do not obstruct them. They are fulfilling a sacred duty—cleansing Czechia of German scum. \n\nAlso, in the near future, degermanization and denazification of cities will take place, all German names will be replaced with Czech ones, Czech will be declared the only state language, and German will be banned in all public places. Czechia for the Czechs!\n\nThus ended the speech of Alois Grebenchik. After some time, the newly formed national security battalions marched through the street.

Special work was being done by propaganda, which called on ordinary citizens to be in solidarity with the troops. Finally, a few hours before the operation began, a decree was read out in the battalion locations, exempting from criminal liability the killing of Germans who resisted eviction. \n\n\nAnd so, finally, that day arrived. After Alois Grebenichek announced the start of the operation, pogroms of Germans began throughout Czechia. According to a pre-prepared plan of action, the battalions began to act: kicking down the door of an apartment or house, they drove the Germans out into the street. Those who resisted were shot on the spot. They were lined up in columns and driven to the border, regardless of the losses among them. The main goal was to drive the Germans out of Czechia, which was carried out by any means necessary. \n\n\nBy morning, Operation 'Czech Night' was completed. At least, its first stage. Now it was necessary to deal with several emerging problems: it was necessary to quickly expel the Germans from the territory of Czechia. For this purpose, each battalion had five trucks. They were crammed as full as possible with the escorted people and taken to the nearest border.

The Germans in the Sudetes were the majority and were able to put up a worthy resistance to the national security battalions. But the forces were unequal, so a systematic shooting of all those resisting began. This enraged the former Wehrmacht soldiers, so Kurt Knispel raised his people in rebellion. \n\nThe training of his soldiers, hidden weapon caches, and motivation allowed them to successfully fight against the Czech troops. But operating during the day in enemy-controlled territory was true suicide. Therefore, his detachment decided to go into partisans. Small counterattacks on national security units bore fruit—the detachment grew quickly and engaged in skirmishes with the enemy not only at night but also during the day. \n\nSoon it came to the point that all Czech military formations in the Sudeten region were subjected to attacks by Knispel's troops. Because of this, they were forced to leave the Sudetes, and Operation 'Czech Night' was hastily curtailed there. For now, Grebenichek is in no hurry to send his troops into a trap and is waiting for Knispel to make a mistake. He, in turn, is adhering to the same tactics. Moreover, Czechs began to be expelled from the Sudetes using the same methods as Grebenichek. For now, one thing can be said with complete certainty..."

'Due to the difficult situation in the Sudetenland, I DEMAND the destruction of the German militia, the CAPTURE of infrastructure nodes, and the COMPLETION of "Czech Night" in the Sudetenland!' This order was sent to all units of the Czech army. The commanders immediately deployed their subordinates to the area of the supposed location of the 'Remnants of the Wehrmacht.'\n\n\nIt is expected that personnel losses will begin to grow exponentially, but one cannot go against the order... Grebenichek also demanded to act quietly and unnoticed by the GUOT and the Garrison, because he has no answers to their questions."

Schmidt was making full use of the second chance he had received.\n\nBut finally, the phone fell silent, and Schmidt could rest. Pouring whiskey into his glass, he pondered his situation and looked out the window. The sunset blinded him, and he involuntarily turned away. People were walking home to the loud chirping of birds. 'Beautiful!' thought Waldemar. After drinking the contents of his glass, he returned to the phone calls.\n\nSuddenly, someone knocked on the door. 'Excuse me, I'll call back,' Waldemar said into the phone and allowed entry. It was Andreas Baader, formerly his comrade, one of the leading members of the Red Army along with Ulrike Meinhof.\n\n'Hello, old man,' Schmidt said joyfully.\n\n'I'm glad to see you too,' Baader replied.\n\n'What brings you here?' Schmidt inquired, filling his glass with another portion of whiskey.\n\n'Thanks, I won't,' Baader declared. 'I'm here on business.'\n\n'Well, spill it,' Schmidt exclaimed enthusiastically.\n\n'My guys have found the location of the Werewolves. Of course, we'll try to handle it peacefully, but we don't rule out an aggressive turn of events. Could you turn a blind eye to this incident?'\n\n'Hmm,' Schmidt said without his previous enthusiasm. 'You understand the risks, right?'\n\n'Of course, Walter, but their crimes cross all boundaries, you know?'\n\n'Alright, but this is the last time, got it?'\n\n'Okay, Waldemar, okay,' Andreas said enthusiastically and hurried to leave.\n\nThere were certainly many more such requests from members of the Red Army and other armed groups, and Waldemar tolerated them.

Since the democratic government was established in Westphalia, her life had become much closer to its end.\n\n\nAt the appointed time, Baader was in the bar, drinking another mug of good beer. Suddenly, someone grabbed him by the collar and pulled him out through the back door into the street.\n\n'Are you out of your mind!' hissed Meinhof, 'Didn't you see the Werewolves in the bar?'\n\n'I-I just...' mumbled Andreas, quite affected by the alcohol.\n\n'Let's get out of here quickly before anyone sees anything.'\n\n'Okay.'\n\nThey walked in silence, occasionally glancing at each other to assess the situation. Finally, arriving at the park, they could discuss plans.\n\n'Since the collapse of the German Reich, the Red Army has lost a significant number of members, as many consider the goal achieved. But we know there's still a lot of work to do,' declared Meinhof.\n\n'We need to start a new wave of propaganda. Right now, there are many ideologically inclined young people looking for a calling.'\n\n'I agree, but we need to act carefully; we're close to collapse. The GUOT and the Garrison have seriously taken up the RA, and we urgently need to re...'\n\nBefore she could finish her sentence, a bullet from a Werewolf's pistol hit Meinhof in the chest. Immediately, Baader opened indiscriminate fire at the presumed location of the shooter. Hearing a fading groan, he lifted Ulrike.\n\n'Damned Werewolves...' she whispered faintly.\n\n'Wait! Hold on! You can't!' Andreas shouted. 'There's still a lot of work to do!'\n\n'Remember!... You... must... continue... the revolution... in Germany...'\n\n'Yes, Comrade Meinhof...'\n\nShe showed no more signs of life. Baader needed to quickly leave the scene of the murder.

But Baader's appearance was unexpected.\n\nBursting into the office without invitation, he saw Walter putting down the phone and began:\n\n'They killed Ulrike, Waldemar, ULRIKE!'\n\n'Who killed her?' Schmidt asked in confusion, with an unfinished sandwich in his hand.\n\n'Those bitch pigs—the Werewolves. Right on the street, Walter, you understand, right on the street!' Andreas said, out of breath.\n\n'I understand you,' Schmidt said grimly.\n\n'No, Waldemar, you don't understand a damn thing!' Andreas exclaimed. 'She died in my arms. I must continue her work, our work, you understand?'\n\n'Well, I'll arrange for a funeral ceremony...'\n\n'What the hell funeral, Waldemar?' Andreas interrupted. 'Those bastards will come again and shoot all of us. They need to be destroyed. All of them. To the last one. I'll do it all myself, just give your consent.'\n\n'You want to arrange a mass slaughter of the Werewolves?' Waldemar clarified.\n\n'Yes, that's exactly what our time demands,' Andreas confirmed.\n\n'No,' Schmidt said calmly.\n\n'What do you mean, no?' asked the stunned Baader.\n\n'I will not allow war to break out on the streets of Westphalia. My only and final answer is no. I understand your pain, but this is too much,' Schmidt explained judiciously.\n\n'You'll regret this, you understand? You'll regret it dearly! When the flame of revolution illuminates all of Germany, you'll be begging for mercy, but I won't give you a damn thing, got it? You'll regret it dearly! You'll rot in the same ditch as THOSE FUCKING WEREWOLVES!' Andreas Baader shouted as security forcibly escorted him out of the office.\n\nSchmidt looked out the window.

Politicians from various parties took turns expressing their opinions on the draft, its pros, cons, and the very purpose of issuing it at such a moment. And while the monotonous voice of the speaker filled the air, Maximilian, the head of Baden, silently nodded out of politeness. \n\nFrom the very beginning, he had tried to persuade his colleagues to let him go and hold the session without him, but they were adamant. 'If you're not there, there's no point in gathering,' they objected. Maximilian would have gladly canceled this foolish event, but something inside him made him come after all. \n\nAnd so he had been sitting there for about an hour and a half, with voices changing one after another. 'Lord, are there a thousand of these people?' he pleaded inwardly. His status and position were almost accidental. Unbeknownst to him, he turned out to be the closest heir to the King of Baden, or so he thought. In any case, he neither knew how nor wanted to govern a state, but such was his fate. \n\nIn his thoughts, he cursed each of those present for daring to drag him away from his beloved winery. He was one of the best winemakers in Baden, but now he was forced to sit and listen to the chatter of these men. Sinking deeper and deeper into his thoughts, Maximilian didn’t notice when he fell asleep. However, he wasn’t too concerned about it, had he known. After all, sleep would be much more beneficial than 'listening to the bill on the new constitution of the Kingdom of Baden-Württemberg.'"

Spending time there was, in his opinion, the best and most useful thing he could do. Urging his personal driver, who was also his best friend and fellow winemaker, he was at his workshop in half an hour. \n\nAfter chatting with the workers, whom he knew personally and was on good terms with, he went to his friend and taster, Dak Zalder. Maximilian complained about his restless life, and Dak offered him a fresh red semi-dry wine. The monarch gladly accepted and, thanking his esteemed friend, hurried to his office. \n\nToday, he decided to do something more or less productive—read. But he chose wisely. 'After such a busy week, I need to rest!' thought Maximilian and took 'Sherlock Holmes' by Arthur Conan Doyle from the library. Pouring wine into his glass and sitting in his armchair, he began to sip it thoughtfully, trying to discern the subtlest notes of flavor. But the first glass ended too quickly, and Maximilian couldn’t fully appreciate it. So he drank another, and another... when the bottle was empty, the monarch’s hands first dropped, then the book fell from them, and finally, he fell asleep sitting in the chair."

Not fully comprehending what had occurred, he nevertheless decided to crawl to the closet and get dressed.\n\nSuddenly, outside the window, Maximilian heard gunfire, someone’s scream, and people entering his house. Half a minute later, soldiers of the Royal Guard—a special unit of the troops—entered his room. The one who seemed to be the leader said:\n\n'Your Highness, please follow us,' and handed him a helmet.\n\n'A-alright,' the winemaker timidly agreed, and they headed for the exit.\n\nDespite a strong desire to learn the details, his survival instinct allowed him to do so only after they got into the car.\n\n'What’s going on?' asked Maximilian.\n\n'There was an assassination attempt on you, Your Highness,' the soldier replied bluntly. 'After the issuance of certain laws against former Nazis, they decided to overthrow you and your government. According to the information we have, fascists have risen in the west of Baden-Württemberg. Leading the rebellion is none other than Ernst, damn it, Röhm.'\n\n'And what do we do next?'\n\n'I believe we should take you to a safe place and request instructions from Berlin.'\n\nHaving received an answer to his question, Maximilian fell silent and took one last look at his house, his winery, and realized:"

His decision to start an uprising at the moment when Russian troops had already crossed the Oder became a sign of legitimacy for Moscow. Gil himself came to him to discuss the terms under which Scheel would be the head of state.\n\nSuddenly, the phone rang. Picking up the receiver, he heard:\n\n'Hello, is this Walter Scheel?' a man inquired.\n\n'Yes, that’s me,' Walter replied with slight surprise.\n\n'Glad to speak with you. I have a very interesting proposal for you,' the man said.\n\n'Well, I’m all ears.'\n\n'You see, in the past, I had quite close ties with the Nazis, was one of the leading industrialists, so I fear for my life.'\n\n'Alright, I understand you,' Scheel responded.\n\n'Could you provide me with the opportunity to settle in the Rhine? In return, I’m ready to offer you full or almost full protection. Moreover, my subordinates are willing to work for you. Agreeing with me is in your best interest.'\n\nAfter pondering the proposal for a few seconds, Scheel finally answered:\n\n'Well, I think your proposal is quite advantageous. I’m ready to give you a plot and handle all the paperwork.'\n\n'Excellent,' the industrialist replied, 'I’ll explain the nature of this protection later.'\n\n'Good, goodbye,' Scheel concluded the conversation.\n\nAnother Nazi was fleeing to the Rhine from the oppression of the new governments. And Scheel made the difficult decision to shelter them. In return, he received valuable employees and other useful things, like protection. But he was already beginning to suspect that such volumes might arouse suspicion from many, including the Garrison and Gil. Therefore, he needed to reduce the flow of such refugees. But he loved the benefits too much."

Gil inquired.\n\n'Overall, not bad, it could be much worse.'\n\n'Glad to hear it. But I’d like to ask: how long will you keep accepting Nazis?' Understanding the trickiness of the question, Gil probably smirked.\n\n'I’ll stop accepting them soon.'\n\n'Soon—when exactly?' Gil pressed.\n\n'Within the next month.'\n\n'Alright, but how many have you already accepted?' Gil was becoming more insistent.\n\n'How should I know? I don’t keep track of them,' Scheel replied.\n\n'Your approximate estimate.'\n\n'About a few hundred officials of various kinds.'\n\n'Okay, Walter. You know I love you, so I don’t meddle too much in your affairs, but know that you can do this without consequences only until the end of the month.'\n\n'Of course, Vladimir.

 TaS_GEREpilogue.20.d: "Over the past few weeks, the situation in the Rhine has changed dramatically. After the flow of Nazis was artificially reduced, scattered Werewolf units began flooding in, intending to change the situation. Scheel might have suspected they would want to alter the status quo, but the method they chose to solve this problem came as a complete surprise to him.\n\nBy 10 a.m., several trucks full of armed Werewolves arrived at the central square of Strasbourg. They surrounded Scheel's administration and prevented anyone from approaching. Soon, their leader issued demands: the armed forces in Strasbourg must lay down their weapons, and Walter must surrender along with his guards. Scheel was given half an hour to think.\n\nHe was in a hopeless situation. The Werewolves had cut the telephone and most telegraph lines. Walter was doomed. He asked the leader of the surrounding forces to release the women from the staff, and after some thought, they agreed to fulfill this request. 'Now my conscience is clear,' thought Scheel. After half an hour, the Werewolves demanded an answer. If he refused, they planned to blow up the building. Soberly assessing the situation, Scheel agreed to surrender the city garrison and himself.\n\nWhen it seemed that nothing could save him from imminent death, heavy gunfire erupted from different streets, targeting the Nazi militants. Scheel decided to take matters into his own hands. Grabbing a machine gun from one of the dead soldiers, he began firing at the Werewolves. Soon, they decided to abandon Strasbourg and flee as far as possible, but the roads were blocked. They had no choice but to surrender.\n\nIt turned out that one of the soldiers was on leave in the Rhine capital when the Nazis stormed in. He didn't hesitate and immediately reported it to his comrades, who promptly set out from the nearest units to Strasbourg. Walter Scheel personally congratulated this soldier and said he would be awarded a medal.\n\nHaving recovered from the initial shock, Walter reflected on what had happened. 'You know, this is just the beginning,' Walter said to himself, 'the Nazis feel their power, that's why they attack. And in a way, they're right.' The silence was interrupted by a phone call. Scheel already knew who it was. Moscow. Gil or Bayerly. It didn't matter. He needed to come up with something quickly so they wouldn't remove him from his position."

Among them were several former Reich officers, soldiers, and even one quite respectable-looking industrialist. Late at night, they still tried to stay as quiet as possible to avoid attracting the attention of the Bavarian military.\n\nTime passed slowly, and they were starting to get nervous. Young officer Heinrich approached his old acquaintance, Siegfried; they had served together in the German army, fought in the civil war and the second West Russian war.\n\n'What do you think,' Heinrich began, 'maybe he ditched us, took the money and ran?'\n\n'Listen, I've known Max for a long time; he's already smuggled many across the border, don't worry.'\n\n'Yeah, but he's been gone for a while. And I feel like someone is watching.'\n\n'Friend, it's just nerves; everything will be fine.'\n\n'Maybe you're right.'\n\nHeinrich sighed and even calmed down a bit when suddenly the clearing came to life. It started with a single shot in the air, then armed men retreated from the clearing. Eventually, all those trying to escape were loaded into a truck with Bavarian State insignia. Max stood nearby, watching it all. Did he feel guilty about it? No, he was avenging the Nazis. Would he continue doing this? Yes, he would never forget what they did to Maya."

He pressed the same keys every 15 minutes. He couldn't stop, even though the skin on his fingers was almost worn away; he continued, for if he stopped, they would shoot him. The patrols of the Bavarian forces had changed several times; it seemed this was already the fifth.\n\nSomething throbbed in his head, his eyes watered, but he kept going. Around him stood the soldiers—unwashed, unshaven; just recently, they had been slaves, and now they stood over him. They laughed, rejoiced; the music clearly pleased their ears, but his strength was running out. Soon, the former Reich soldier would lose consciousness.\n\nAnd then he couldn't hold back any longer. 'Please... let me go... I was just a driver... I'm... I'M SORRY,' the involuntary musician screamed. Soon, he felt someone pat him on the shoulder. Through the ringing in his head, he heard: 'Calm down.' And then, with difficulty lifting his head and opening his tear-filled eyes, he saw the barrel of a pistol aimed directly at him. In an instant, the white keys were covered in blood mixed with the remains of the Nazi's skull. 'We'll have to tell the next ones that the concert is over,' said one of the soldiers. 'Yeah, he was starting to play off-key towards the end anyway,' said another. And so the squad left the building, leaving the musician lying on the floor. The next patrol would take the body."

It was already almost 10 p.m. Hastily returning to reality, he headed home. Walking through the streets of his beloved Vienna, he involuntarily thought about other cities. Berlin, which was the capital of the world, was turned by Albert Speer into an ugly concrete colossus, the main purpose of which was to demonstrate the power of the Nazis. Rome suffered much less from the fascists but was still turned into a 'capital for displaying strength.' But Vienna surprisingly survived.

If you give power to the right, the left will rise, and vice versa. The world is changing. Nothing can be changed.' \n\nThen he fell silent and looked out the window for a long time.

Otto, as a lover of precision, was going to outline the whole picture happening in Austria.

By seven o'clock, the garrison was completely destroyed, and the bodies of the executioner soldiers hung on street poles, giving everything around an atmosphere of some madness and revolutionary fervor that did not abate for a minute. \n\nBy ten o'clock, a total pogrom of shops, banks, and police stations began. All this became the target of popular anger. A little later, the arsenal also fell under the pressure of the crowd. And at the head of all this stood Baader, who personally arrived in the city. \n\nAround noon, he stood in the square surrounded by ordinary people tired of the oppression of the bourgeoisie, the Nazis, and the Russians who occupied these lands and later handed Germany over to loyal tsars. Now was clearly not the time for long and loud speeches, but Baader figured out what to do. With a couple of jerks, he climbed onto an armored personnel carrier, like another revolutionary leader half a century ago, and began to deliver his speech. 'Comrades! The time has come for the workers of Austria and Germany to throw off the shackles of imperialism, to wrest Germany from the hands of the bourgeoisie and foreign influence. Today, the bourgeois have given us an unprecedented gift! They gave us a machine gun! A machine gun with which we will bring down the cities of those who are not ready to accept the revolution. And you are witnessing the birth of a new Germany, free, honest, and strong! So let's, comrades, make a great leap towards communism and free the Motherland from its tenacious paws!' When Baader finished, he decided to take a better look at the crowd around him. \n\nThese were not ragamuffins, not expendable material for burning in factories. Around were jubilant and shouting people. They were ready to follow Baader anywhere, even to hell, as long as it made Germany great again. The only thing Baader was thinking about after the inspection was unusual, however. Abstracting from the crowd and the noise, he wondered: 'What will be the last sound I hear? I hope it will be a shot...'"

Even then, he was amazed at how pictures came to life on the screen, and in 'Triumph of the Will,' he could personally be at the sixth annual NSDAP congress. Heroes of ancient times and modernity came to life before him. The films had an incredibly powerful influence on him. \n\nThen the war began, in which Kurt felt like the main character, or at least they tried to portray him as such. 'The most effective tankman in history,' 'Hitler's tank ace,' he was literally showered with titles and became a hero to many. But deep down, he didn't understand if that war was necessary. After all, sometimes wars are fought without any particular reasons. \n\nAfter it, he just wanted to be alone but couldn't. Even a house in the Sudetes, a family, and a decent number of servants couldn't drown out the sounds of conscience. Every night he woke up from nightmares. And every morning, he left quickly, preferring to spend time outside. \n\nAnd now, the tankman had a chance to become a real hero for his people. He climbs into the tank again, knowing that the night is short and the goal is far. Long ago, he swore to the Germans that he would defend them to the last, and now it was time to keep that promise. To become what he was always called and what he always wanted to be..."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.30.d: "Remer's day began quite calmly; the artillery guns were not firing at his position, and there was even a sense of some calm. The enemies of the new Germany were currently defeated, and he could even rest a little. With sluggish, blurred movements, he finally made it to the closet and looked at his uniform, all dirty with drops of blood... 'I'll have to order a new one a little later,' the general thought to himself. Nevertheless, almost reaching the door, he decided to sit in the chair. A couple of minutes wouldn't make a difference now. \n\nBut then something unexpected happened: a sharp knock on the door disrupted all the plans of the new Führer. On the other side stood a young soldier, looking somewhat inappropriate: wild eyes, disheveled hair, something was clearly wrong. 'Rockets! The Russians have launched!'—no formalities, no address, but even that was enough to make Otto's pupil dilate. His heart pounded wildly, and in his head, it was as if a concert began, squeezing out the remnants of reason. \n\nIt will be very difficult to describe the events further. In a state of affect, Remer jumped into an armored personnel carrier and set off towards the nearest bunker. Everything that could mix up in his head did. The plans were ruined, and was there any point in hiding in the bunker at all? \n\nNevertheless, after half an hour of driving, the armored personnel carrier approached an inconspicuous shelter somewhere in the forests of Germany; it was a place for only one person due to the size of the bunker and the amount of supplies there. The soldiers saluted Remer for the last time as he closed the hatch behind him. He couldn't believe it; the work of his entire life was collapsing for the second time because of the damned Russians. When the general pulled himself together and decided to go out, something shook the bunker, as if a giant monster was walking through the forest above. The Reich general didn't find the strength to go outside. \n\nAnd now he was alone in the bunker, the executioner of the German people, like Sisyphus, whose work had just been reduced to atoms. In the darkness, he nevertheless managed to light a candle on a small table and sit down on a chair. Somewhere in his pocket, he felt a cross; there couldn't be a better moment for it. Remer took it in his hands, folded them in a prayerful pose, and closed his eyes."

Peaceful resolution? What are you talking about? – Said the Führer warily.\n\n- You see, my Führer. Let's say your candidacy for the post of Führer is somewhat unsuitable for the majority, and we would like to resolve this issue peacefully. Don't worry. The security of you and all your relatives will not be discuttable. But otherwise, if you refuse, we will have to resort to coarser methods and remove you from office by collegial decision. Moreover, you should not rely on the support of coarser forces; this will no longer help you. – He spoke with the same sly smile.\n\nAnger seemed about to burst out of Speer, but being a man who relies not on emotions, he calmed down and put his thoughts in order.\n\n- I need to think about your proposal. – Speer said calmly.\n\n- No problem, my... Führer. – Saying this, Oberländer began to leave.\n\nThroughout the rest of the day, Speer found out what forces and in what quantity he had, but knowing this, he initially did not want to come to terms with such quantities, tried to think of something and undertake, but after another day, he understood, and with the onset, he resigned himself to the fact that he had no chance of remaining Führer.\n\nHow could I lose in the most important political game of my life? Again and again, the Führer thought to himself.\n\n- My Führer. – Those same words sounded again, and turning around, Speer saw his assistant.\n\n- My Führer. Mr. Oberländer is on the line. He asks some strange question: are you ready to agree to resolve the issue in a favorable direction, the details of which, as he said, you know. – Said the assistant.\n\nAfter thinking for another second and trying to see a favorable solution not for the conservatives, the Führer turned back to the assistant.\n\n- Tell Oberländer...

 TaS_GEREpilogue.38.d: "After the resignation of the Führer and thus the fall of one of the two pillars between the Gang of Four and now the officially conservative government, an invisible war began.\n\nThe conservative government could not officially begin purges of its new supporters, who still had enough influence to harm the new conservative government. The Gang of Four, which, with the fall of the Führer, officially supported the conservatives, becoming new supporters, hoped to still hold on to power, but the conservatives did not need them, just as the Gang of Four did not need the conservatives.\n\n- Helmut. Your task is both very simple and not at the same time. It is necessary to eliminate one of the representatives of the former Gang of Four, but to make it look like the work of the opposition and terrorists. – Read the content of the letter, which Helmut remembered well.\n\nBeing a sniper and a former member of anti-terrorist units, now, Helmut, with resignation, was a mercenary who was only concerned with the fee.\n\nSpending a long time conducting surveillance and preparing what was necessary to eliminate the target, Helmut was ready. By a certain day, a certain hour, and down to the seconds, Helmut was in position. The convoy of the former gang member arrived, and as soon as the car in which the target was located stopped, it was in Helmut's sights.\n\nThe gang member who got out took two steps and a second later fell, and a pool of blood began to spread around his head. Panic gripped the street, and the guards hurriedly ran to their master, but it was too late.\n\nHaving previously left evidence pointing to third parties not involved in this murder, Helmut quickly left the position, taking all the evidence that could lead to him or the employers, including taking the cartridge case, one of the most important pieces of evidence.\n\nTwo weeks later, the remaining former members of the gang were killed by other mercenaries."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.39.t: "The Unbending Party"
 TaS_GEREpilogue.39.d: "The motorcade that arrived at the Reichstag building, from which Oberländer exited, followed by many more cars with other members of the government. Another government meeting to resolve current issues. Walking across the square, this magnificent creation, as Oberländer thought, inspired him. Entering the Reichstag building and finding the usual bustling work of the staff and already arrived officials, Oberländer was even more inspired.\n\nAfter all the formal and informal purges and rearrangements, the atmosphere felt like a return to the era before the civil war and earlier, when Hitler still led the Reich. The same unity, unbending spirit, and purity of the party and government.\n\nInspired by everything that was happening, believing that after all that had happened, the course was becoming more correct, Oberländer headed to his office since there was still time before the meeting. After drinking a cup of coffee before the meeting and arriving at the beginning, the chairman of the Reichstag took his seat, intending to continue improving and making the development course more correct."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.40.t: "Victory!"
 TaS_GEREpilogue.40.d: "Climbing the steps leading from the motorcade straight to the entrance of the Volkshalle, Führer Speer looked quite joyful; there was even a small smile on his face. Reaching the entrance, the Führer entered, where his retinue was already waiting for him.\n\n- My Führer. All delegates have arrived and are taking their seats. Please follow me. – Said the chairman of the Volkshalle, pointing with his hand in the direction of future movement.\n\nWalking through the corridors and a few minutes later approaching the entrance leading to the main hall, the Führer ordered his assistant to hand over the prepared papers with the speech. Taking the papers a few moments later, Speer entered the hall.\n\nStepping out, the Führer ascended the podium, and the hall, seeing its leader, exploded in greeting the Führer. As soon as the hall calmed down, the Führer, adjusting the papers once more, looked at the hall.\n\n- Gentlemen. Today, precisely today, that memorable day has come when we have once again proven our superiority to the eastern barbarians. The Reich, every son or daughter of it, over all the past months of the war, has demonstrated the power and greatness of the Aryan race and its achievements, which allowed us to stop the Asian hordes and, with a counterstrike, inflict a crushing defeat on the barbarians who encroached on our world! At this very moment, our valiant troops are reaching the line A-A, which we had previously lost, and in the rear, parades are being held on the occasion of the return of the lands back to the bosom of the Reich! After their latest defeat, the Jewish-Bolshevik barbarians will never again be able to encroach on our territories. Long live the Reich! – Finishing, the Führer, like all senior members of the party, government, or military command, raised his right arm upward, half-bending it, while junior members extended their right arm forward, and together, with a joyful cry, filled the hall with the words."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.41.t: "Brandt's Problems"
 TaS_GEREpilogue.41.d: "Sitting in a café, Willy reread the newspaper for the umpteenth time.\n\n- But how could this happen? – He asked himself.\n\n- Victory! – The headline proclaimed, and the text beneath it spoke of another victory of the Reich in another West Russian War.\n\n- The second one already. And again unsuccessful. Eh...– Thought Brandt to himself.\n\n- Speer's speech in the Volkshalle on the occasion of the Reich's victory. Phew... More pomposity. – Brandt continued to think and say to himself, delving into the reading. After reading a little more, Willy put down the newspaper and just started thinking.\n\n- After the Reich's victory, it's as if everyone in it has gone mad. How do they not see that ordinary people were killed in this war? Hundreds of thousands of people were ground up. Hundreds of thousands of ruined lives. And how many more lives will the Reich ruin with its insatiable appetites and its very essence? When will people finally see that this machine serves the interests of the elite, and the good existence of the German people is ensured by the destruction through slave labor of hundreds of thousands recognized as subhumans in unbearable work? No, of course, now with the reforms, they are not subhumans, but still the same disenfranchised slaves of the Reich! – Brandt wanted to slam the table. But he stopped.\n\n- Reformed Nazism. A nightmare. And now people continue to support it en masse, and the number of supporters is only growing. How did this happen, where did the mistake occur that turned everything this way? – Thought Brandt to himself.\n\n- Sir. What will you order? – Brandt heard, and turning his head towards the voice, he saw a young waitress. For a few moments, examining her, he saw the 'League of German Girls' badge, which somewhat alarmed Brandt.\n\n- Thank you. Nothing. I'm already leaving. – Saying this, Brandt took the newspaper and headed for the exit."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.42.t: "Gradual Reforms"
 TaS_GEREpilogue.42.d: "The Reichstag meeting had never been as stormy as this time. The meeting held marked the initial stage of reforms. When the chairman of the Reichstag ascended the podium and, having voiced the proposals, descended. A heated discussion began. Discussions went on, new proposals and ideas were discussed, everything was included in the general report. But when the meeting ended, the package of documents was ready to be handed over to the Führer.\n\nThe meeting was over, and Chairman Oberländer handed the package of documents to the messenger for delivery to the Führer. The messenger headed to the Führer's residence, located directly opposite the Reichstag. Exiting, a car was waiting for him. Reaching the residence by car in a few minutes and ascending to the Führer's office in a few more, the messenger handed the package to the secretary.\n\n- My Führer. Permission to enter. – Said the secretary, standing in the doorway of the open door. – Having received approval, the secretary approached the Führer working at the desk and handed over the package of documents, after which he left the room.\n\n- So, what do we have here. Liberalization of the economy, first stage... Minor changes in political doctrine... Social reforms. Initial stage... Review of the military sector... Reforms in the Reichskommissariats... Interesting. – The Führer said aloud and began to study each set of documents separately.\n\nAn hour and a half later, the Führer finished studying and, putting down the last folder, reached for the direct line phone with the chairman of the Reichstag.\n\n- My Führer. Oberländer is listening. – Came the voice from the receiver.\n\n- I have studied the documents you sent."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.43.t: "The Plan"
 TaS_GEREpilogue.43.d: "- My Führer. – The assistant's words sounded, destroying the silence that filled Speer's office. When the Führer invited his assistant to, strangely enough, look at important state documents and give his assessment of their meaning and their future.\n\n- I'm not entirely sure of my thoughts, my Führer. – Said the assistant, closing the folder and staring at the Führer turned to the window, not saying another word.\n\nAfter a few more seconds of silence, the Führer, separating his hands in front on his chest, lowered them, clasping them behind his back.\n\n- What exactly are you unsure about? Tell me. – Said the Führer and turned to the assistant, starting to look at him intently.\n\n- My Führer. I doubt that reorganizing our most dangerous commissariat, transferring it from a military district with a military administration to a civilian administration and creating a puppet out of it like a civilian state, and even with 'opportunities' for these Slavs... is a good idea. – Said the assistant and fell silent. After thinking for a few seconds, the Führer moved and headed to his desk. Sitting down, the Führer looked at the assistant again.\n\n- No. This is a good idea because it will not strengthen various groups of rebels and resisters but weaken them. By giving these Slavs the most basic opportunities to satisfy their needs, we will thereby make it unattractive to die for various ideas, but to somehow survive without fear of being killed at any moment. Yes, this will reduce support, but not everyone will agree even with this, but with the remaining ones, when they become minimal, it will be much easier to deal with, shedding as little Aryan blood as possible. As a result, we will forever pacify these lands and secure our conquered living space and our Aryan settlers. – Said the Führer, and on his face, one could see a shrewd and at the same time evil smile spreading. After thinking for a short while, the assistant himself began to smile like the Führer, clearly understanding the genius of the plan.\n\n- Transmit the order to begin reorganization. – Said the Führer, and the assistant jumped up from the chair."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.44.d: "Oberländer arrived at work as usual, pausing to survey the Volkshalle and the square before it. Reinvigorated by the sight, he entered the building, where his government and council colleagues greeted him. He arrived early for the meeting to review correspondence and reports already laid on the Reichstag Chairman’s desk. After finishing his coffee, he headed to the council chamber. As others filed in, Oberländer took his seat and sank into thought.\n\nSuddenly, the doors burst open. Soldiers flooded the room within seconds—some through main entrances, others from side exits—their weapons trained on the assembled officials.\n\n—What is the meaning of this?! — Oberländer shouted, rising to his feet. The soldiers remained silent.\n\n—What is happening? — A familiar voice echoed. Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner strode through the doorway.\n\n—Allow me to explain, Herr Oberländer. You are arrested on charges of treason and conspiring to dismantle our glorious Reich. The entire council stands accused as accomplices. — The government officials, Oberländer included, stared in shock at the morning’s abrupt turn.\n\nBy day’s end, Schörner’s loyalists had seized the Reichstag, Volkshalle, Führer’s Palace, and all strategic sites in the capital. The Reich now lay firmly in Schörner’s grip."

More lethal and larger in scale than both the first conflict and civil war combined, this war dealt a severe blow to the Reich, yet it endured.\n\nNow, after all these events and proclaimed post-crisis reforms, the Reich presents itself as 'renewed and more friendly' according to its leadership. But does changing the wrapper alter the contents? And if so, what can be expected from the 'New' Reich?"
