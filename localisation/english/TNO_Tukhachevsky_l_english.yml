 tukha_ultimatum.29.t:0 "White Flags on the Border"
 tukha_ultimatum.29.d:0 "A series of white flags rising on our border with Tukhachevsky's West Russian Revolutionary Front has marked us as the clear next target for his expansionist desires. The radio message that accompanied the event, as well, has made no doubt of his ambitions towards us.\n\nAs stated in the radio message, we shall have three days to surrender to the Front, turn over our military to Tukhachevsky's command, and make our lands ready to be administered by the Arkhangelsk government. If we are to surrender now, it continues, our generals and government shall be pardoned, and is free to go into exile, or continue serving under the Front.\n\nIf we fail to comply, one more warning will be given, after which our government is no longer guaranteed to be pardoned. If this warning is not heeded, Tukhachevsky promises, we will meet nothing but total annihilation at the hands of the Red Army.\n\nWith the increasingly powerful Front bearing down on us, and their banners visible from the border, it seems that the time has come to either bend our knee, or make a stand."
 tukha_ultimatum.29.a:0 "For the safety of the people, we must yield."
 tukha_ultimatum.29.b:0 "For the Tsar, we will stand against the traitors!"

 tukha_ultimatum.30.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses Our Terms!"
 tukha_ultimatum.30.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused to respond positively to our generous offer of surrender and amnesty. Troop movements from within their borders have been reported by our spotters, and it seems that they are preparing to repel an armed incursion by our forces.\n\nThey, of course, are unaware that doing so will merely delay their bitter end. On their border, we shall raise the red flags, and deliver their final warning. They have refused our most generous first offer, and so we must penalize them for such through prosecuting their government if they surrender, but we shall make it absolutely clear that this is the best - and the last - diplomatic offer that they shall receive.\nOur armies are readied, and our officers already convening to defeat the fortifications that our potential enemy has revealed to us in their panic to present a viable resistance. There exist two options, and two only. Surrender, or face total annihilation at the hands of the triumphant Red Army."
 tukha_ultimatum.30.a:0 "The easy way, or the hard way."

 tukha_ultimatum.31.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Surrenders!"
 tukha_ultimatum.31.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our demand of surrender, turning over their arms, standing their military down, and transferring the administration of their territory to the Front. Already, inspection of their armed forces has begun, as well as re-training and re-education where necessary in order to ensure a reliable auxiliary corps.\n\nWith this fortunate turn of events, our timetable for the unification of West Russia has been set forward greatly, and we can freely begin comprehensive integration of the newly acquired territory into our own organs.\n\nA military government has been established over the region, with officers that distinguished themselves in our past conquests becoming the provisional governors, pending the recruitment of local administrators."
 tukha_ultimatum.31.a:0 "Excellent."

 tukha_ultimatum.32.t:0 "The Final Warning"
 tukha_ultimatum.32.d:0 "In response to our refusal of Tukhachevsky's initial terms, the Front has delivered its final warning. Dark red flags fly over the border, visible from our forward positions. Beyond the horizon, surely, the Bolshevik armies are preparing themselves for the assault.\n\nThe latest terms for our state have been broadcast across the lines, clear and plain as day. We are to surrender immediately, dissolve our army, hand over all military equipment to the Front, and allow their units to cross the border in order to prepare our state for integration. Most notably, the provision stating that our governors and generals shall receive amnesty has been revoked.\n\nAs the critical hour approaches, and our final preparations are made, panicked deliberations begin behind the lines. Those less patriotic about our cause have begin to migrate southwards, away from the path of the invasion, if it is to come.\n\nThis is the final, darkest hour before the storm falls upon us. Shall we surrender to the red tide, or shall we stand strong and hope to overcome it?"
 tukha_ultimatum.32.a:0 "We have no choice, anymore. We must bow."
 tukha_ultimatum.32.b:0 "Never! We will never give in to the Bolsheviks!"

 tukha_ultimatum.33.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses the Final Warning!"
 tukha_ultimatum.33.d:0 "The time for our final warning to be accepted has come and gone, and the only solution left is war. A comprehensive, total war shall be executed, to utterly crush the opposition present within [FROM.GetNameDef].\n\nOur officers shall be ordered to begin their advance immediately, and our artillery to begin their shelling in order to cover the initial attack. With our surveillance of the positions arrayed against us complete, the enemy has no hope of resisting the overwhelming fury of our attack.\n\nThe declaration of formal hostilities shall coincide with the landing of the first shell in their territory. There will be no mercy for traitors to the Motherland."
 tukha_ultimatum.33.a:0 "So be it."

 tukha_ultimatum.34.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Surrenders!"
 tukha_ultimatum.34.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our demand of surrender, turning over their arms, formally dissolving their military, and transferring the administration of their territory to the Front. Critical points in their territory have been occupied, borders closed, and records seized, to ensure the criminals among their leadership meet justice for their crimes\n\nWith this turn of events, our timetable for the unification of West Russia has been set forward greatly, and we can freely begin comprehensive integration of the newly acquired territory into our own organs, once the counter-revolutionary elements among the former leadership are comprehensively disciplined.\n\nA military government has been established over the region, with officers that distinguished themselves in our past conquests becoming the provisional governors, pending extension of our control over the area, and direct integration into the Front's heartlands."
 tukha_ultimatum.34.a:0 "Sufficient."

 tukha_ultimatum.35.t:0 "The Storm Breaks"
 tukha_ultimatum.35.d:0 "As black flags rise on our border, and the declaration of war is received over radio, the first Bolshevik artillery shells have landed within our territory. The war against the Front is upon us, and we can only hope that our forces can break the onslaught of the Grand Marshal.\n\nOur men shall stand bravely, until the very end, be it against chemical cloud, armored column, or infantry surge, and our officers are proud and prepared to fight. With the skill of our army, and fate on our side, we shall be the fortress that shatters the West Russian Revolutionary Front for the last time.\n\nIf we are to fall, let it be as heroes, and if we are to triumph, let us ring eternal in the halls of history - Invincible, and Legendary!""
