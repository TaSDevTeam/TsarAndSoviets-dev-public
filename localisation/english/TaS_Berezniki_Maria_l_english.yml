 MAR_the_true_heir_desc: "Among all the candidates presented at the Zemsky Sobor, only Maria Romanova had any legitimate claim to power—the daughter of the infamous collaborator, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, who, not without the influence of the Mladorossi, abdicated the throne in her favor. This means that the ten-year-old Grand Duchess has now been declared Empress of All Russia, and due to her minority, a regency must be established. Unfortunately for Bek, no one rules alone. Thus, it is now necessary to organize a regency council, forcing the Mladorossi and Vyatka monarchists to coexist despite recent conflicts."
 MAR_golden_cage_desc: "The Tsaritsa is a child, so we must ensure her well-being and the best possible education."
 MAR_and_the_keybearer_desc: "Kazem-Bek managed to become the unifier of Western Russia, protecting the people and assembling a strong army. But the task of reviving Russia remains his responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility. And absolute power corrupts absolutely."
 MAR_all_royal_court_desc: "The time has come to assemble the regency council. It must equally represent both the Mladorossi party and honor the terms of the agreement with Vladimir's faction. Despite this, Bek intends to retain the final say for himself, keeping a few aces in the council to represent the people."
 MAR_kazembeks_people_desc: "The campaign has ended—for now. The ROA, the Red Army, and many others have fallen before us. And we could not have achieved this victory without Vladimir Gil and Sergei Belozersky! After all, it was Sergei Belozersky who led our Tsarist-People's Militia from victory to victory, crushing all who stood in the way of Unity. And it was Vladimir Gil, who redeemed his guilt before the Motherland, who established the state security system that shielded us from enemy intelligence and internal threats.\n\nThanks to these men, we succeeded, and it would be disgraceful not to reward them. Gil and Belozersky will join the regency council to provide the young Tsaritsa with a firm foundation. The security services and the army, loyal to the Crown, will never allow anyone to overthrow the Empress!"
 MAR_old_bosses_desc: "Vyatka was a fairly successful state—a volatile synthesis of old imperial bureaucrats, Nazi collaborators, and the hereditary Romanov aristocracy. As a result, its brilliant army and finely tuned state apparatus (compared to the Aryan Brotherhood and others, of course) made Vladimir's domain an invincible force. Naturally, like every other state in Western Russia, the Principality of Vyatka fell before the Tsarist-Soviet host, but its old officials held on surprisingly long.\n\nMany of them still wish to serve the Romanov throne, be it Vladimir III or Maria. Moreover, Vladimir’s own involvement in Maria’s victory at the Zemsky Sobor was part of the deal. Reintegrating a group of bureaucrats into the state apparatus, under proper supervision, will pacify our most radical supporters and allow us to hear the voices that once brought Vladimir III to power—albeit briefly."
 MAR_the_functionary_desc: "Pyotr Demichev is an utterly unknown Soviet functionary—which is, generally speaking, a good thing. 'Quiet Pyotr,' as Alexander Lvovich calls him. But despite the illusion of his insignificance, Demichev’s efficiency as a statesman is nothing short of astonishing."
 MAR_vox_populi_desc: "Alexander Lvovich’s deck contains not only aces but also jokers. After all, a fully loyalist regency council where no one dares oppose Kazem-Bek could plunge the country into chaos without checks and balances. This system will be represented by two people’s delegates in the council: the rising star Iosif Brodsky and the theologian Boris Talantov, who advocates for the revival of the Holy Synod."
 MAR_judas_will_be_in_heaven_desc: "Is redemption possible? God forgives all if a man is willing to repent for his sins. But we are not God, so the question is more complicated for us. Vladimir is far from a good man. Only Vlasov and his ROA surpassed the stigma of being a collaborator Tsar, yet even so, Vladimir’s reputation remains tarnished.\n\nAs unfortunate as it is for Vladimir and his loyalists, it is through abdication that he can atone for his crimes against the Motherland. Though he renounced the throne, he cannot be 'cast out' of politics entirely. His counsel—both as a former Emperor and as a father—will be invaluable to Maria. After all, would a father truly wish harm upon his own daughter?"
 MAR_to_urgent_matters_desc: "The regency council has finally been formed. Now, the finest men in all of Western Russia will guide and educate the young Empress until she is ready to rule autocratically."
 
 ##events (normal ones)
 MAR_maria.1.t: "The End of One, the Beginning of Another"
 MAR_maria.1.d: "Vasily Makarovich Karpenko was reading the latest issue of "To Young Russia". Confusion was written on his face—the article announced that Minister of Economy Alexey Kosygin-Romanov had signed his resignation. It seemed strange to him that, as the minister’s personal secretary, he hadn’t been informed.\n\nAn hour later, Kosygin-Romanov arrived at the Ministry of Economy to bid farewell to the staff and thank them for their diligent work. After his speech, his former secretary approached him.\n\n— Alexey Nikolaevich. A moment, please.\n\n— Vasily Makarovich. Did you need something?\n\n— I wanted to ask. Why are you resigning?\n\n— I’m leaving because I wish to attend to personal matters. My life isn’t just service to the Mladorossi. I have a family and my own business.\n\n— Why didn’t you tell me?\n\n— I didn’t want to trouble you. I thought it best for Kazem-Bek to receive my resignation directly. By the way, it came as a surprise to him. Now he’ll have to find a suitable replacement.\n\nAfter saying goodbye to his former superior, Vasily returned to his apartment, where he spent a long time over a cup of coffee, pondering the resignation. The future of the ministry seemed uncertain and turbulent."
 MAR_maria.1.a: "Changes Loom in the State Apparatus"

 MAR_maria.2.t: "Sudden Tango"
 MAR_maria.2.d: "— What?!\n\n— You’ve read the order, Comrade Gil. You’re now the head of the Imperial Security Service or ISS for short.\n\n— With all due respect, Alexander Lvovich, the MGB—or rather, the ISS—certainly needs restructuring. But do we really need... them?\n\n— The "Okhrana" has proven its effectiveness, hasn’t it?\n\n— Yes, undoubtedly. But you need to see this.\n\nGil pulled a folder wrapped in black cloth from his desk and placed it before Kazem-Bek. Inside were maps detailing the regent’s daily routes, reports on his habits, meetings, hobbies—and most damningly, an assassination order signed by Evgeny Messner and Vladimir III. Kazem-Bek exhaled heavily, rubbing his temples. After a minute of silence, he pushed the documents back to Gil.\n\n— Hide these. They’ll be leverage if Romanov tries to deny it. Change all communication channels and passwords in the MGB before restructuring begins. Former Okhrana members are to be monitored—24/7, for now. Those who’ve proven loyalty may remain.\n\n— And the disloyal?"
 MAR_maria.2.a: "— Bury them"

 MAR_maria.3.t: "Public Reading"
 MAR_maria.3.d: "Today was not meant to stand out. The usual hum of hurried citizens, tinged with weariness, filled the streets of restless cities. Yet unexpected exceptions are inevitable.\n\nA small crowd gathered outside one of the many libraries. Soon, an event organized by none other than Iosif Brodsky would begin. The poet had decided to share works written during his anguish over the Motherland’s fate. Clearing his throat, Brodsky bowed his head and began. His first piece was a short poem:\n\n"No sorrow, no love, no grief,"\n"no dread, no ache in the breast,"\n"The age of darkness now behind us,"\n"only light ahead at its best."\n"Look back—and surely you’ll witness:"\n"Vlasov’s men behind bars,"\n"Past the churchyard, young trees whisper,"\n"guarding the Tsaritsa afar,"\n"From some unknown distant quarter,"\n"a young sentry’s whistle takes flight,"\n"While the piano’s mindless clatter" \n"drifts above you into the night."\n"You won’t grasp it, yet you’ll feel it:"\n"Why not split your life in two—" \n"Leave half to the five-domed churches,"\n"half to the basalt, cold and blue."\n\nThe poem, stirring hearts, was met with rapturous applause. Cries of "Bravo!" echoed through the hall. More attendees trickled in, drawn by the event.\n\nBowing gratefully, Brodsky announced the start of the public reading and his readiness to share more works. Meanwhile, a thought took root in the crowd: at last, someone had emerged to voice the people’s anguish—through eloquence and art."
 MAR_maria.3.a: "The Art of Words Shatters Silence"
 
 MAR_maria.4.t: "A Chilly Reception"
 MAR_maria.4.d: "Entering the dimly lit chambers of the temple, Kazem-Bek saw Antipin bent over the Book of Revelation. Not wishing to interrupt, he tried to sit quietly opposite him but accidentally elbowed an Order of St. George flag mounted on the wall, sending it crashing down. Turning at the noise, Antipin set aside the scripture and sat across from Kazem-Bek.\n\n— Father Antipin, I’ve come to visit and share glad tidings.\n\n— You wish to restore the Synod, do you not?\n\n— How... How did you know?\n\n— When the Romanov girl was declared Tsaritsa, all became clear. I know you’ve no intention of relinquishing power—and why would you? You’ve just conquered all of Western Russia.\n\n— And we couldn’t have done it without the Order. I beg you, trust us. The Synod must return. The Church and the House of Romanov were always allies; so it shall be again.\n\n— What ‘alliance’ do you speak of? The Synod system is the Romanovs’ tool to control Russia’s ecclesiastical life. God’s servants would become mere instruments of the Okhrana, as they once were.\n\n— There will be limits, but not as you describe. Please, Father, give me and the Tsaritsa a chance. We’ll not deceive or betray you or any faithful in Russia.\n\n— This is not what we expected of you, Kazem-Bek. These are not God’s matters. Yet only time will reveal the purity of your intentions.\n\nThe Order’s founder rose from the table. Gazing at a burning candle, Antipin gave Kazem-Bek a silent nod before returning to his reading."
 MAR_maria.4.a: "What remains for God’s work when Caesar looms above it?"

 MAR_maria.5.t: "First Day on the Throne"
 MAR_maria.5.d: "Maria was surprised to see *To Young Russia* headline the victory of Kazem-Bek’s faction in the Regency Council—her nominal supporters. For her, far removed from politics, it seemed intriguing. Now she wasn’t just a princess occasionally underfoot during ministerial negotiations, but a future Empress. Yet she barely understood what she ruled. Until her majority, everything would be governed by Regent Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek of Berezniki. Below, however, a crowd awaited: journalists, photographers, dignitaries, and even former Economy Minister Alexey Romanov-Kosygin, who’d endorsed her candidacy.\n\nA knock startled her. Through the door, she recognized Kazem-Bek’s voice:\n\n— Maria Vladimirovna. They’re waiting downstairs. Are you ready?\n\n— Yes. I’m coming, Alexander Lvovich,\" she replied, stepping out.\n\nAs they walked toward the hall, Kazem-Bek asked about the speech she was to deliver.\n\n— Maria Vladimirovna, have you reviewed the text we provided yesterday?\n\n— I have, but I’m afraid I couldn’t memorize it.\n\n— That’s unnecessary. A copy will be on the podium. Glance at it if needed.\n\n— Thank you, Alexander Lvovich.\n\n— Remember, there’s no need to worry. This is just a simple address.\n\nEntering the hall where Defense Minister Sergey Belozersky had spoken, Maria gasped at the crowd—reporters, officials, officers.\n\n\"And now,\" announced Vladimir Sergeyevich, \"Her Imperial Majesty Maria Vladimirovna Romanova.\" Applause erupted as she approached the podium.\n\nHer knees nearly buckled under the weight of stares. But steadying herself, she began with only a slight tremor in her voice."
 MAR_maria.5.a: "\"I wish to thank those who cast their votes for me as Tsaritsa of Western Russia...\""

 MAR_maria.6.t: "French Lessons"
 MAR_maria.6.d: "Alexander Kazem-Bek walked the halls of the Vyatka Palace, stopping by the study where the Empress was having her French lesson. He’d just returned from a brief trip to Kazan.\n\nAfter knocking, the tutor informed him she was on a short break. When Maria saw Alexander, she rushed to hug him, beaming.\n\n— How are your studies? I heard you’ve taken an interest in history.\n\n— Yes, Alexander Lvovich. I want to understand why our state remains divided.\n\n— And the language? You once said you disliked French.\n\n— I’m trying. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes not.\n\n— But effort is what makes us human.\n\nThe tutor reappeared, signaling the break’s end.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Alexander, bidding Maria farewell.\n\nAs he left the palace, memories surged. He’d known her father, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich, well—recalled being exiled to Berezniki over their disagreements. Now their roles were reversed: he, the all-powerful Regent; Vladimir’s daughter, a puppet on the throne. But his regency wouldn’t last forever. Sooner or later, he’d have to step aside.\n\nAn officer interrupted his thoughts: \"Alexander Lvovich, the car is ready.\"\n\n\"On my way,\" he replied."
 MAR_maria.6.a: "The future seems murky and uncertain"
 
 MAR_maria.7.t: "Grown-Up Politics"
 MAR_maria.7.d: "Maria walked down the now-familiar corridors of Vyatka Palace, fiddling with her rag doll. Suddenly, her play was interrupted by voices from a slightly ajar office door—a heated discussion between two men.\n\nInside stood Alexander Kazem-Bek and an officer in uniform. To the young girl, their words sounded like an argument.\n\n— Alexander Lvovich, MGB units have done enough to suppress remnants of the Aryan Brotherhood. I recommend redeploying them to other regions—they’d bolster other MGB divisions.\n\n— Ruslan Yakovlevich. I disagree. Until we fully eradicate the Aryans, redeployment is premature.\n\n— They’re too weak for large-scale terror now. Let the Interior Ministry handle them. The security services are needed elsewhere.\n\nListening silently, Maria mentally sided with Kazem-Bek—though she barely grasped the debate. Her support stemmed solely from seeing him as an unshakable authority. After all, he was the Regent.\n\nWhen the officer left, Maria entered the office.\n\n— Alexander Lvovich, what were you arguing about?\n\n— Nothing important. It’d be hard for you to understand.\n\n— Honestly, all this politics talk sounds dreadfully boring.\n\n— I know exactly what you mean, Kazem-Bek replied with a faint smile.\n\n— I’ll go back to my room and play.\n\n— Alright, go rest."
 MAR_maria.7.a: "Even adults need a break from politics"

 MAR_maria.8.t: "Sporting Rivalry"
 MAR_maria.8.d: "Vodka—the beloved alcoholic drink—glistened in faceted glasses. One evening, Alexander Kazem-Bek and Sergey Belozersky gathered to discuss the Zemsky Sobor’s outcome.\n\n— History has a twisted sense of humor, eh? Kazem-Bek smirked, refilling the glasses. A child defeats a general for the throne. Tell that to anyone, they’d laugh in your face.\n\n— Mmm, you sure know how to cheer a man up... Belozersky drawled after a sip. After a pause, he added: But honestly? I’m not bitter. You win some, you lose some. As a military man, I know that well.\n\n— Can’t argue there, Alexander conceded, draining his glass.\n\n— My point is... If kingship wasn’t in the cards, I’ll focus on what I *do* have. Sergey refilled their glasses.\n\n— A toast, then! Alexander raised his freshly poured glass. To finding strength after every fall—no matter the failures or obstacles.\n\nBelozersky laughed heartily but joined the toast. Glass clinked against glass, yet the night was young. So much left to debate, to challenge, to affirm."
 MAR_maria.8.a: "Defeat must be met with dignity"

 MAR_maria.9.t: "Noir Detective"
 MAR_maria.9.d: "Final orders were issued—at last, Vladimir Gil could breathe. Briefly. Rumors of merging two security agencies, the MGB and Okhrana, had been confirmed. The question was: how and when?\n\nThis problem, which Gil had pondered for weeks, stirred both intrigue and dread. This wasn’t mere integration... No. This would shift the balance of power.\n\nTo monitor the process, Gil aggressively gathered intel: fresh rumors, strategic bribes, interrogations, potential leaks—anything helped. He’d uncover every detail personally.\n\nBuried in paperwork, Gil carried out his routine as events unfolded calmly—or so he thought. Then a document landed on his desk: the final order.\n\nReading it, Gil’s face darkened. The merger he’d tried tracking was now a done deal—without his realizing *how*. Slamming his fist on the desk, he muttered..."
 MAR_maria.9.a: "How the hell did they pull this off?"
 
 MAR_maria.10.t: "Far From Home"
 MAR_maria.10.d: "The rhythmic knocking of wheels on the rails seemed to lull the passengers rushing from Vyatka to Arkhangelsk. Numerous landscapes flashed by outside the windows as Maria Romanova sat gazing into the distance, trying to catch at least a glimpse of what was fleeting before her eyes.\n\nMany thoughts swirled in her head: her first trip beyond Vyatka, Alexander Kazem-Bek's latest instructions regarding upcoming events, the unexpected acquaintance with a certain Pyotr Demichev. All of this weighed heavily on her as a burden of responsibility...\n\nHer eyes wandered across the empty train car, studying its interior. There was room for many people here, but for now, there were only two—herself and Demichev. She examined this man with a careful gaze, trying to understand what lay behind his serious demeanor.\n\nMaria sifted through the few conversations she had managed to have with him... His cold and indifferent gaze, his perpetual immersion in some papers, his near-total lack of interest in most topics of conversation... As if his heart had room only for work.\n\nIn the end, Maria concluded that Pyotr Demichev was an utterly uninteresting personality, one who could see no further than his position and the endless stream of papers and documents. Shaking her head, she carefully stood up and went to prepare for the event in Arkhangelsk, hoping to pass the time on her journey."
 MAR_maria.10.a: "Numbers and feelings are incompatible things"

 MAR_maria.11.t: "Vox Dei"
 MAR_maria.11.d: "Strolling leisurely around the room, Boris Talantov conducted another theology lesson for Maria. This time, he decided to delve into the past to emphasize the importance of faith in bygone eras.\n\n– During the civil war that erupted after the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks revealed their true, horrifying nature. Having rejected divine guidance, they committed atrocities against the very people they had sworn to protect.\n\n– But... then why did they win? The people wouldn’t just tolerate their cruelty... – Maria asked with genuine curiosity, listening intently to Talantov’s words.\n\n– Because what they fought for mattered to the people. They defended ideas that could undoubtedly offer true hope to any person. And the people hoped that one day, they would receive everything the socialists promised. But time passed. And the Bolsheviks, who had betrayed God, could not grant the people the fulfillment of their dreams, for they knew their own repulsive lies and the impossibility of realizing their promises without turning to God.\n\n– So, you mean... a good idea was ruined by godlessness?\n\n– Exactly. Faith helped man distinguish between good and evil, always striving for the former. Without faith, that boundary blurs, and those who should defend the downtrodden may commit the unforgivable, aligning themselves with the devil and leading innocent souls into sin.\n\n– I see... – Maria replied pensively, reflecting on what she had heard.\n\n«God and ideas... United, yet so dependent on one another...» Maria thought to herself."
 MAR_maria.11.a: "Only a truly faithful person will not stray from the path"

 MAR_maria.12.t: "Vox Libertatis"
 MAR_maria.12.d: "Entering the room, Brodsky surveyed it with a glance. The workers were putting the finishing touches on the preparations. Once everything was ready, Brodsky took his place in front of the microphone and, after reconsidering his thoughts, nodded to signal he was ready. The radio station went live.\n\n- Good evening, dear listeners. Today, we would like to begin our program with a speech by Mr. Iosif Brodsky. Mr. Brodsky, please, you may speak. – Said the host.\n\n- Thank you, gentlemen. I wish to address all citizens of Russia. To address my supporters and non-supporters alike. I, Iosif Brodsky, with full understanding and full responsibility, want to assure all citizens of our country, all the people of Russia, that as a member of the regency council, I will make every effort and strive to justify the hopes of my supporters and non-supporters alike—that I will become a defender and a conduit for the voice of the people, helping to realize and fulfill all their ideas and desires. – Brodsky delivered his speech calmly, though occasional hints of emotion slipped through, betraying his clear excitement at being included in the regency council and the opportunities now before him."
 MAR_maria.12.a: "Forward to Freedom!"
 MAR_maria.13.t: "Everyone in Their Place"
 MAR_maria.13.d: "Kazem-Bek's office. The regent himself and the newly arrived Vilchkovsky. Cigarette smoke filled the room—from who knows how many cigarettes smoked—and for the past hour, they had been discussing the political landscape, planning for the future, and reviewing the past. The discussion about who else could be invited to the regency council had reached a dead end, and for the last five minutes, both the regent and Vilchkovsky sat in silence, lost in thought.\n\n- Alexander Lvovich, what if we invited the former Vyatka bureaucrat and politically rigid conservative Vasily Vitalyevich Shulgin? – Vilchkovsky said, stubbing out and crushing his cigarette into the ashtray, which already held many identical butts.\n\n- Hmm... – The regent pondered, rising from his chair and slowly pacing the office. Stopping by the government meeting table and resting his hands on the back of one of the chairs, Kazem-Bek turned his head toward Vilchkovsky. – I think that would be a good decision. But we still need more people. – Alexander Lvovich said. Vilchkovsky lit another cigarette."
 MAR_maria.13.a: "We'll keep thinking."
 
 MAR_maria.14.t: "Don't Stare into the Abyss"
 MAR_maria.14.d: "The central park of Berezniki was a beautiful place and a favorite spot for business meetings. So, Smyslovsky decided to meet with someone not in a dusty office but in the fresh air. Walking near the fountain and changing direction after reaching an invisible boundary, Smyslovsky waited for the man from Vyatka. A few more minutes passed, and right on time, a man appeared from around the bend on the path leading to the fountain. In less than ten seconds, the man approached Smyslovsky.\n\n- Are you Mr. Smyslovsky? – He asked.\n\n- That’s correct. – Smyslovsky replied curtly.\n\n- In that case, pleased to meet you. – The man said, extending his hand.\n\n- Likewise. – Smyslovsky replied, shaking the hand of the former Okhrana interrogator. The interrogator was one of many former Okhrana members who had joined the new ISB security service, becoming a powerful voice in the development of Berezniki's and the Kingdom’s intelligence apparatus.\n\nAfter shaking hands, the two intelligence officers slowly walked down the park alley. Almost immediately, a conversation began between them. At first, they spoke about the past of their respective organizations, then smoothly transitioned into discussing the newly created ISB, even sharing occasional laughter—two former enemies now colleagues. Just as smoothly, the discussion turned to the current capabilities of the new service and what would be done to strengthen it for the future."
 MAR_maria.14.a: "The Future is Secure"

 MAR_maria.15.t: "A Day in the Life of Alexander Isayevich"
 MAR_maria.15.d: "Since the defeat of Vladimir III, Alexander Isayevich had almost languished in obscurity, and today his plans remained unchanged. After returning to his apartment from what he considered important but ultimately inconsequential affairs, he had lunch and turned to creative work, sitting down at his typewriter. For several hours, Solzhenitsyn was immersed in writing, but a sudden knock on the door distracted him. Rising from his desk, he walked down the hallway and opened the door to find a postman standing there.\n\n- Alexander Isayevich, a letter for you, if you please. – The postman said, handing over the papers to sign. After signing, Solzhenitsyn received the letter, and the postman bid farewell before leaving. Alexander Isayevich closed the door and returned to his study. Entering the room, he already knew who the letter was from—the return address was the office of Regent Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek himself, which greatly surprised him. Opening the envelope and unfolding the letter, he began to read...\n\nGreetings, esteemed Alexander Isayevich. This letter is from the secretary of Regent Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek. I will not waste time with unnecessary words and get straight to the point. By order of the regent, you, as a former prominent official of Vyatka, are invited to return to active political life, join the regency council, and assume the position of Minister of Economy for the Kingdom. You may take time to consider and make a measured decision, as we impose no strict deadline, but we kindly ask you not to delay.\n\nAfter reading, Solzhenitsyn sat back in his chair. After brief reflection, he stood up and began preparing for a meeting with the regent—and a meeting with his future."

 MAR_maria.16.t: "Judas Will Be with Me"
 MAR_maria.16.d: "The palace of the royal family was vast. Inside were many rooms and chambers: corridors, halls, sitting rooms, bedrooms, and other spaces. On this day, father and daughter—Vladimir III and Maria I—were relaxing in one of the sitting rooms. The father was reading a newspaper, while his daughter played with her many toys.\n\n- Daughter. – Vladimir said.\n\n- Yes, Papa? – She replied, looking up from her toys.\n\n- I see you have new toys. Did Alexander Lvovich give them to you? – He asked.\n\n- Yes. They’re from him. – Maria answered.\n\n- Nice toys. I also saw he gave you new books. Are they from him too? – Vladimir continued.\n\n- Yes, Father. Some of the toys and books he gave me personally. – She replied.\n\n- Hmph... Sometimes it feels less like gifts and more like handouts from him. – Vladimir muttered, flipping a page in his newspaper.\n\n- But Papa, how can you say that? He gave them with a smile and kind wishes. – Maria said, surprised.\n\n- Yes, but was it sincere? Or just because it was expected of him, to maintain appearances? Well, never mind, let’s drop the subject. – Vladimir said, raising the newspaper again and disappearing behind it.\n\nAfter this conversation, Maria was left confused. The more she thought about it, the more puzzling it seemed, and Kazem-Bek’s actions somehow began to feel less benevolent."

It seemed Maria was growing accustomed to her role as 'tsarina'.\n\n— Maria Vladimirovna, if you need anything, don’t hesitate to call at any time, — said the maid before slowly leaving the room.\n\n— Klavdia Evdokimovna, thank you for your care. I don’t need anything else tonight, — Maria replied calmly. Stretching by the door, she walked toward her bed.\n\nCollapsing onto the bed from exhaustion, the tsarina sank back into her thoughts. 'I’m tired,' she whispered to herself. 'Couldn’t Uncle Sasha and Papa handle the country without me? Why am I so necessary for all this—endless meetings, balls, travels? And that... what’s his name, Boris Alekseevich... he scares me. It’s hard to trust him.' She sighed heavily, sinking deeper into her worries. 'Maybe I shouldn’t have become tsarina.' 'I don’t want this, I don’t want any of it. I just want to live peacefully again. I’m scared—' Muffling a scream into her pillow, this was the last thought Maria had before drifting into the realm of Morpheus."

 maria_magica.2.d: "The evening’s anxious thoughts gave way to dreams, the scenery shifting one after another. But this time, Maria sensed something amiss. Slowly opening her eyes, she found herself in a bizarre space—fragments of buildings floated in the sky, the ground was covered in chrysanthemums, and the landscape shimmered with shifting colors.\n\n'Wh... where am I?' she blurted out, her first coherent thought. Looking down, she saw a golden spear in her hands, its hilt adorned with a small clock. Her attire was nothing like that of an ordinary girl—or even a tsarina. Instead, she resembled an ancient warrior from legends. But was this... real? What was happening?\n\n'Hey, Masha, quit daydreaming!' shouted an unfamiliar blonde girl around her age, leaping around a shadowy creature with a saber in hand. —Now’s your chance, the witch is vulnerable, go!\n\n'R-right!' Moving almost instinctively, Maria jumped forward, thrusting her spear into the creature’s neck. A guttural roar erupted from the mass as it swelled—then burst. The surreal landscape dissolved into a forest on the outskirts of a city.\n\n'Nice work, huh?' The girl grinned, skipping toward her. —What do you think, Kyubey?\n\n'Yes, you performed correctly. If you continue like this, you’ll have no trouble gathering Grief Seeds,' said a white, cat-like creature.\n\n'Wha—?' Before she could speak, an alarm clock’s ring cut her off. Bolting upright, Maria looked around. 'It was just a dream... but I felt so happy there. If only it were real...' she murmured wistfully. But something was wrong. On the windowsill sat...\n\n'Hello, Maria,' said the white creature from her dream."

Yet... the creature was still there, perched on the windowsill, watching her with round pink eyes.\n\n— Maria, there’s no need to worry. I’m completely real, and this isn’t a dream, — a voice echoed, though the cat’s mouth didn’t move as its tail flicked.\n\n— W-wait, hold on! Who are you, and why were you in my dream? — Maria nearly shouted, staring into its face.\n\n— I am Kyubey. I’ve come to offer you the chance to become a magical girl. As for the dream... perhaps, as you humans say, it was 'prophetic.'\n\n— A magical girl?.. Why me? What does that even mean? Do I have to do something?\n\n— Yes. You’ll gain power. I sensed your immense magical potential, which is why I’m here. To transform, you must make a wish.\n\n— A wish? Any wish, and you’ll grant it? But... there’s a catch, right?\n\n— Correct. I’ll grant any wish you desire. In return, you must fight witches.\n\n— Okay... but what can I wish for? — Gazing at the ceiling, Maria sifted through possibilities. — No, I know what I want. — Her voice steadied. — Kyubey, can you really grant anything?\n\n— Anything you wish.\n\n— Alright, Kyubey. I... need time to think.\n\n— Of course. The choice is yours. I won’t force you."

Unbothered, it lounged or paced nearby like a house cat.\n\n— Kyubey, stop following me! Someone might see you, — she whispered.\n\n— No need to worry. Only you can perceive me right now.\n— Really? Well... I trust you, I guess.\n\nToday’s agenda included a trip to Izhevsk’s arms factory. Departure was set for noon. After finishing her preparations, Maria was escorted to the car. Inside sat Kazem-Bek, Smyslovsky, and her father, Vladimir Kirillovich. Tension hung thick, ready to ignite at any moment. The car moved, but the uneasy silence remained.\n\n— Boris Alekseevich, was your presence truly necessary? — Kazem-Bek broke the silence.\n— As a regency council member, I’m entitled to accompany the empress, — Smyslovsky replied mockingly. — Or am I wrong?\n— I fail to see how your presence benefits anyone here, — the regent snapped, barely containing his anger.\n— What’s your proposal, then? Dump me in the woods? You orchestrated this farce—elections and a regency despite her father being alive. Regretting the people’s choice? Would you have preferred the Kosygin-Belozersky clique? More pliable, were they?\n— At least I wouldn’t be stuck here with you.\n— Let’s redo the Sobor, then. Crown yourself Alexander IV? Foreign-born tsars aren’t unheard of. Then you wouldn’t need to tolerate criticism.\n— Boris, you’re crossing a line... — Kazem-Bek hissed through clenched fists.\n— Both of you, enough! — Vladimir Kirillovich cut in. — This isn’t the time.\n\nThe rest of the trip passed in silence. Maria requested an abbreviated factory tour, citing fatigue—over Kazem-Bek’s objections.\n\nNight fell again. Maria showed no sign of having heard the car argument.\n\n— Kyubey, are you there? — she asked softly.\n— I am, Maria. Have you decided? — The white creature materialized on the windowsill.\n— ...Yes. Kyubey, I wish the Zemsky Sobor’s outcome had been different, — she declared, resolve in her eyes.\n— Then it shall be. — Kyubey replied."

But everything appeared prepared for the arrival: food ready in the kitchen, guest accommodations arranged. Even Vladimir Kirillovich, who after the Zemsky Sobor had become governor of Vyatka Province, was in high spirits.\n\n— Vladimir Kirillovich, the Tsar is arriving, — the concierge's voice suddenly interrupted the governor's light doze in the gazebo.\n— Very well, Arkady. I'll greet him personally. I hope everything goes perfectly, — rising from the bench, Romanov walked toward the gates.\n\nIn the distance beyond the fence, a small motorcade became visible: a couple of GAZ-M1s, one ZIS-150, and a relatively new American Continental. As the convoy approached, the servants grew increasingly tense. Only Vladimir Kirillovich remained composed.\n\nContrary to the staff's worries, Sergei Sergeyevich, visiting for the first time, seemed pleased with everything. Evening fell, and in more relaxed atmosphere sat the former Tsar of Vyatka and current Tsar of Western Russia.\n\n— How do you find the Monomakh's Cap, Sergei Sergeyevich? Your thoughts?\n— Vladimir Kirillovich, I've no complaints. Governing a country, as you know, comes with difficulties, but it's my duty as autocrat.\n— Quite right. I wonder, would others have handled it as well as you?\n— I dislike hypotheticals, Vladimir. But reflection is always necessary. Hmm...\n\nSuddenly Sergei Sergeyevich's face contorted in pain. He swayed, clutching his head. \"No, something's wrong, I'm... I'm...\"\n— Fetch a doctor immediately! — Romanov shouted, jumping from his chair.\n\n— No need, I'm fine... just a strange moment, — Belozersky gasped heavily."

Glancing toward the window, she saw the same creature that had offered to make her a magical girl.\n\n— Kyubey, so... it came true? — Maria asked weakly.\n\n— Yes, everything happened as you apparently wished, — Kyubey replied.\n\n— Apparently? What do you mean? — Maria tilted her head.\n\n— In this timeline I'm meeting you for the first time, so most likely you wished to change the past.\n\n— Ah, you're right... — biting her lip, Maria didn't elaborate.\n\n— Now look at your left hand, see the ring?\n\n— Yes, but what is it? Wasn't it supposed to look like an egg? — Maria examined the ring with its greenish gem.\n\n— That's your Soul Gem. You must protect it, because if it breaks, you'll never use magic again.\n\n— Okay, but what do I do with it now? — the girl kept bombarding Kyubey with questions.\n\n— Visualize your Soul Gem as an egg in your mind, then touch it.\n\n— Got it... — Maria closed her eyes and grasped the crystal. Her clothes flashed and transformed into armor, a golden spear appearing in her other hand. Opening her eyes, she whispered: \"Just like in that dream...\". Rising from bed, Maria began practicing spear moves like she'd seen in movies. Getting carried away, the spear sliced clean through a chair. The crash brought her back to reality as her armor vanished, leaving ordinary pajamas.\n\n— Maria, I wouldn't recommend wasting magic power so carelessly. Overuse will cause problems, — Kyubey warned.\n\n— Aww, but can't I have a little fun? — Maria pouted. — It's so exciting!\n\n— Regardless, you should be more careful.\n\n— You gave me this power and now say not to use it. Fine, I'll be careful, — she sighed."

 maria_magica.7.d: "Vyatka, half past midnight. The city slept, ordinary people either in bed or working night shifts. Streets stood empty except for stray animals and occasional homeless. Yet something broke this pattern - a well-dressed girl wandered alone through dark alleys. This was Maria Vladimirovna Romanova, governor's daughter. Though 'ordinary girl' no longer applied... Having slipped out unnoticed, Maria prowled industrial districts holding a glowing gem.\n\n— Kyubey, am I doing this right? I've searched where you said for days but found no witches.\n\n— Witches usually appear where suicide and violent crime rates are abnormally...\n\n— It's flickering! Does that mean a witch is near? — Maria interrupted.\n\n— Yes, follow where the flickering intensifies.\n\n— Okay, — Maria nodded.\n\nShe ran toward an alley. Suddenly her steps grew heavy, surroundings melting into surreal shapes. The dead-end alley extended impossibly, where at its end sat what looked like an animated wheat stalk. Winged airplanes fluttered around it like birds.\n\nThough never facing such things in reality, Maria quickly realized this was the 'witch'. Tossing her Soul Gem, she transformed and took combat stance. \"My baptism by fire... or spear,\" she charged the stalk.\n\nAt ten meters distance, the plane-birds dive-bombed, knocking her off balance. Maria flailed wildly with her spear. Meanwhile the stalk itself moved, its leaf flinging her meters back. Crashing against something hard, she braced for the worst... Until a minute later she opened her eyes to see an older girl slashing the witch apart with a saber. The barrier dissolved as a gray seed fell into the other magical girl's hand.\n\nThe girl landed and glanced at Maria. \"You're new. I'll share this Grief Seed today, but don't expect charity next time.\" She tossed it near Maria before leaping onto a rooftop and vanishing."

 maria_magica.8.d: "— Goodnight, Maria Vladimirovna.\n— Goodnight to you too, Klavdia Evdokimovna. As usual, I need nothing tonight, — Maria watched the maid leave.\nIn truth, Maria had no intention of sleeping. In an hour she'd prowl Vyatka's streets hunting witches. After arranging convincing sleeping-girl dummy under blankets, she slipped out the window.\n\nWitch-hunting had become routine. Though not every night brought success, she'd gained enough experience to handle most witches. \"Ugh, out of practice,\" Maria stretched, recalling the day's events. Night air kept sleepiness at bay, though an occasional yawn betrayed her fatigue.\n\nThe Soul Gem flickered - simple enough, find the barrier and fight. The landscape twisted into abstract art as Maria took stance.\n\nLunge, left, jump, roll, strike, right, strike - battle-hardened instincts guided her movements. The witch lay open for the finishing blow... when her hand slipped on the spear, brushing the clockwork mechanism she'd never touched before. Suddenly she stood a meter back from where she'd been.\n\nStunned by this development, the witch didn't hesitate - one remaining tendril smashed into Maria's stomach, sending her flying.\n\nDamn, what was that... — leaning on her spear while clutching the wound, Maria gasped.\n\nAt that moment, something - or someone - finished off the witch. No... another magical girl had stolen the Grief Seed!\n\n— Hey! Who taught you to steal others' work? — Maria shouted indignantly.\n\n— Oh? Someone's here? — the other girl smirked.\n\n— Give back the Grief Seed. The nice way.\n\n— Come take it. Don't cry later.\n\n— I'd rather not fight another person, but if you insist, — Maria gritted her teeth, leveling her spear.\n\n— Let's see who's stronger then...\n\nSteel clashed as saber met spear. Though battered from the witch fight, Maria parried deftly. Her opponent moved skillfully but more crudely. \"Got you!\" Maria knocked the girl down, spearpoint at her heart.\n\n— Yield?\n\n— Heh, fine. You're strong - didn't think you'd last. What's your name?\n\n— Maria. And you?\n\n— Sofia. We'd make good partners, don't you think? — she smiled genuinely, offering a hand up.\n\n— Hmm, I agree.

Mash, it's been three months since we started fighting together. But we barely know each other. Can you come to the city center tomorrow?\n\n— Uh, I'll try, ha-ha,\n\n— Maria answered, caught off guard by the suggestion.\n\nDespite doubts, Maria decided to go. She knew nighttime Vyatka well, but daytime was unfamiliar territory. Rarely allowed to roam freely, she typically spent daylight hours at the estate.\n\nApproaching the meeting spot, she spotted a waving girl in the distance - unmistakably Sofia. Maria walked toward her. \"Hurry up, turtle!\" Sofia called out.\n\n— Hey, what's the rush?\n\n— Know the saying 'he who hesitates is lost'? Found this amazing spot near the hospital. Their food's incredible.\n\n— That's not how the saying goes...\n\n— Whatever, let's go.\n\nArriving at \"the place,\" the girls faced a neat wooden annex with a \"Bakery\" sign.\n\n— This is where you dragged me?\n\n— Maria asked incredulously.\n\n— Yep, come on in.\n\nThe creaking door revealed a modest yet charming interior. Sofia pointed to a table where they settled into upholstered chairs. Their conversation meandered through life, routines, studies - until a flickering Soul Gem interrupted them.\n\n— Damn, I had so much to tell,\n\n— Sofia sighed mournfully at the crystal.\n\n— We'll chat more later.

It felt eternal.\n\n— Mash, see that village?\n\n— Sofia pointed. \"Something's there. Worth checking.\"\n\n— Bad feeling about this, but I'm with you,\n\n— Maria nodded.\n\nDescending the hill, tension thickened with each step. The abandoned village showed no signs of life - or witches. Just recent emptiness. A rustling in a nearby barn caught their attention. Inside the unlocked shed, a younger girl lay muttering in hay.\n\n— Hate, hate, hate... why me... Lord forgive me... hate.\n\n— Hey, you okay? What's wrong?\n\n— No response.\n\n— Wait - she's holding... a Soul Gem. It's almost black!\n\n— Sofia exclaimed.\n\n— To hell with everything...\n\n— the girl whispered.\n\nThe gem shattered, releasing something resembling a Grief Seed. A shockwave demolished the barn, throwing the magical girls onto the road. As dust settled, the environment transformed into a labyrinth. Without words, they engaged the witch.

Maria too was shaken, but concealed it better.\n\nArriving three days early, they joined a dozen magical girls in Arkhangelsk - each with unique stories and goals.

And in the distance, there was what seemed like an animated bakery, next to which a girl of about 15-16 was fighting. She deftly dodged the spheres flying at her, slicing them apart with a spear.\n\n- What the hell is this. Am I dreaming? Have I lost my mind? — the junior sergeant said, falling to his knees.\n- Lavochkin, cut it out! Don't think, just act now, — Prokopov shouted at him, shooting at the flying clumps of incomprehensible substance.\n- Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, — the policeman continued to mutter to himself. At some point, he stopped speaking, and blood began to flow from his mouth. One of the clumps turned into a spike and pierced the sergeant's back.\n- Fuck, fuck, fuck!

It felt like an eternity passed as they walked. They got close enough to shoot at the creature with their pistols.\n\n- Fire! — Prokopov shouted. Bullets from two pistols flew into its torso. Suddenly, it let out a scream and swung something. The last thing Mikhail heard was, \"Dodge!\"\n\"This must be a dream,\" Mikhail thought to himself, \"I'll open my eyes now and wake up in the office. It just burns a little.\" Opening his eyes, he realized that this was, after all, not a dream. Settling more comfortably against the wall, with his only working arm, he took out a cigarette and lit it.\n\n- Tell me, what was all this?

Can you look to your right?\n- Oh, yeah, — barely turning his head, he saw something resembling a cat, with an enormous additional pair of ears sticking out.\n- Hello, Mikhail. As a token of gratitude to Maria, I can answer a couple of your questions.\n\nIn the end, Prokopov's entire case about the missing girls was connected to this very creature. That there was no way to find them, and that any evidence was meaningless. In truth, the little beast's words raised more questions than answers. But the bigger picture became clear. As soon as the girl and this Kyubey left him, he remained lying on the damp ground."

But few could say much about him—he disliked conversation, preferring silence to noise. Naturally, such reclusiveness spawned many rumors about him.\n\nSome rumors were reasonable, others less so. Some said he was a former collaborator, others claimed he was a foreigner, and others still insisted he had lost someone dear. None of them came even remotely close to understanding what had happened to him. In truth, he didn’t mind the shroud of mystery, because the reality was far, far stranger.\n\nAs a policeman, he had performed his duties honorably until he encountered something indescribable. It was like the dream of a madman, but it was real—a reality that couldn’t be rewritten. After that, he left the Ministry of Internal Affairs and fled Vyatka, where he had lived his entire life. After a brief period of wandering, fate led him to this monastery, where he took monastic vows.\n\n\n\n- Maybe I actually died that night? And this is my punishment for all my sins? — the monk spoke to himself. —I just don’t understand... witches, magical girls, all of it existing alongside ordinary people... Maybe I imagined it all, and we were just attacked by bandits? No, alas, it’s all too real.\n\nMikhail, finishing his musings aloud, grabbed the scythe again and resumed cutting. It calmed him, driving away thoughts of confiding in anyone, for he knew full well that..."

 maria_magica.18.d: "The village of Adyshevo, near Vyatka, was no different from dozens of others scattered across the province. The church at the center of the village was unremarkable. With the rise of the Order of St. George, whether by chance or design, this place became the \"headquarters\" of the local church administration. Fortunately for the villagers, this didn’t drastically change their lives—only a new building appeared next to the church where members of the order lived.\n\nThe local priest, Father Innokenty, did not resist the changes, believing that everything unfolded according to God’s plan. Now, he sat in a gazebo with his assistant, Deacon Grishka, and a warrior of the order, Vasily.\n\n- So, any news from around here? Good or bad? — Innokenty asked the two across from him.\n- Everything’s fine, Father. Except there’s some trouble—villagers have started complaining about a white demon, — said the deacon.\n- A white demon, you say? Have you heard anything else about it?\n- Yes, some girls in different villages have reportedly seen it. They say it looks like a cat, but a very strange one. The order’s members are already making house calls to perform exorcisms—three visits yesterday, — Vasily spoke up.\n- You’re following the procedures, right? — Grishka asked.\n- Of course, God forbid we improvise. And so far, no one’s complained about the beast reappearing.\n- If it disappears, then that’s good, thank the Lord... no place for devilry here, — Innokenty declared. —I think we should hold a service to banish demons and other evil spirits...\n\nWithout a word, both nodded silently. \"We’ll prepare everything for the service perfectly,\" Grishka and Vasily said simultaneously. Then they both stood and went about their usual pre-service routines.\n\nLeft alone, Innokenty pondered: \"A white beast, you say... never seen anything like it... this is all so strange. It’s as if the end times are near. I hope the Lord knows what He’s doing.\" Sighing, the priest also stood and left the gazebo, clutching his cross."

 maria_magica.19.d: "Maxim had a hobby—using an old homemade radio receiver, he loved tuning into foreign radio stations, mostly American ones. Of course, it didn’t always work; sometimes he caught German propaganda broadcasts or something in a language he didn’t understand. Maxim particularly enjoyed finding entertainment stations, where he could hear how people lived on the other side of the world. Twisting the radio dials and adjusting the antenna, he listened carefully to what came through the speakers.\n\nFinally, English speech crackled from the radio. Maxim stopped fiddling and listened intently.\n\n- Hello everyone, this is Ken Likens and Nevada-Six Radio. On our evening talk show, we discuss all sorts of things. And with me is a frequent guest—John Alexander.\n- Hey, Ken, what do you wanna talk about today?\n- Dunno, I’ll let you pick.\n- Right, right—remember that accident the Krauts had on Bornholm?\n- Yeah, the media wouldn’t shut up about it. What’s your point?\n- Have you been keeping up with the frogs lately? I have, and I’ve reached a shocking conclusion.\n- No, sorry, I haven’t. Is this important?\n- Very. Frogs have stopped mating! Now they only try to mate with the same sex. I think it’s all because of the Krauts.\n- The Krauts?\n- Yes! It was actually mind-altering experiments—they covered it up!\n- Hah, but that sounds crazy, doesn’t it?\n- No, no. It all adds up. The Krauts want to change our minds so we stop reproducing. Can you imagine—radio waves turned frogs into homosexuals! Just think about it, FROGS ARE F—\n- I think we should cut to commercials. See you in five.\n\nThe speakers filled with white noise—the signal must have slipped. Maxim sighed. Though he thought everything said was complete nonsense, the idea that people on the radio could casually discuss such absurdity gave him hope. Maybe one day, Russia would be so carefree that people wouldn’t have to constantly dwell on heavy matters."

 SWRW_april_fools.1.d: "With the capture of Petersburg and its outskirts, we 'carved' ourselves a window into the Baltic Sea. Now we have the opportunity to conduct certain military operations. Specifically, the General Staff proposed a limited special forces landing on the island of Bornholm, formally part of the Danish Kingdom. Against the backdrop of old news about an 'accident' on the island and fresh reports of the evacuation of all personnel from there, some generals consider this a perfect chance to uncover what truly happened. Similar operation ideas had been floated before but were dismissed as too risky for the young state.\n\nNow, at war with Germany, we have little to lose. Of course, skeptics remain, but oddly enough, most consider this decision critically necessary. 'We must open the world’s eyes,' 'Let’s expose the Nazis’ secrets,' and similar slogans began echoing in the Supreme Commander’s headquarters.

One of our boys, of course... I hate talking about that. The whole island is littered with tread and wheel marks, as if the Krauts panicked while hauling their loot. We spotted crates and an overturned truck en route. Just need to figure out where they were taking it all. Oh, right—almost forgot.

Germanic ones, by the looks of it, — young sniper Vova rushed to inspect them closer.\n\n—Say what? Speak Russian. — The man raised a skeptical eyebrow.\n\n—Runes... like our letters, but the Germans gave ’em extra meanings. Like the essence of a statement. This one here— —the boy pointed— —'Othala' means ownership, submission.\n\n—Well, damn. — Suddenly, a strange sound echoed beyond the gates—footsteps, then something heavy crashing to the floor, followed by a crackling spark. —Mother of God!\n\nIllarion turned and locked eyes with his soldiers.

A crown that drove its wearer mad, studded with diamonds. A two-headed, scaly abomination in a jar. A gas mask whose lenses reflected a concentration camp, though they were underground. The labels seemed to compete in absurdity.\n\nDozens of such objects filled the space: some on pedestals, others caged as if they might escape, a few just... left on the floor. Or maybe someone dropped their watch and glasses during evacuation. Best not to touch. Yet the squad couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched—a shadow, childlike and playful, darting just beyond their vision. Vova blamed poor ventilation and dim lighting, but something *was* trailing them.\n\nFinally, they faced an incomprehensible device. Resembling a giant fridge covered in runes, it emitted occasional groans. Nearby documents revealed a horrific experiment: Hitler himself had died during the SS coup, and this complex was built by Ahnenerbe to resurrect him. The body revived, but the Führer’s soul remained dead, leaving a hollow shell that withered to a vegetable by 1962. Then, 4–5 years ago (the document lacked exact dates, and Illarion hadn’t brought a calendar), a spatial rift was attempted to restore him—but something went wrong. As Illarion flipped to a page titled 'The Captured God,' Styopan’s shout cut him off."

As their eyes adjusted, they saw... Bornholm Island from a bird’s-eye view. A blue rectangle with an anchor symbol appeared on the map, but seconds later, it was replaced by a folder of carelessly handled documents. To their shock, it contained Colonel Nikonov’s latest diary entry about their division capturing Bornholm. Soon, another window detailed their encounter with the gates.\n\n-'Lyokha, you’re on TV,' Vova joked.\n\nThe next window vividly described their tour of the complex. Sweat beaded on the colonel’s forehead.\n\n-'Enough. Let HQ deal with this damn thing. More devilry. Grab that contraption—we’re leaving.'\n\nAlexei lifted the device effortlessly when a shrill beep echoed through the complex. Then, the machine emitted the same sound that preceded each document.\n\n-'Styopa, quick—read it!'\n\nStyopa’s eyes darted across the text. His jaw dropped—but too late.

GER_collapsed_universe: "Collapse of the Universe"
GER_collapsed_universe_desc: ""A rifle is a celebration, everything goes to hell," a bard once said in his resonant verses. And indeed, everything has gone there. Now, instead of Central Europe, there’s a mishmash of everything and anything. The sudden change of rulers and the entire environment has frightened an already intimidated German people. As a result, we have complete apathy among the population and weak control over our lands. No matter, we’ll break through!"

APF_call_of_north: "Call of the North"
APF_call_of_north_desc: "Our goal is the destruction of the degenerate creation in the south of the country, spawned by globalhomo and other entities. In this, we are aided by the very spirit of Hyperborea, Agartha, and Asgard! As we continue our campaign, the great past will fuel our strength.\n\nWe will surely reach Hyperborea!"

GNR_ze_new_order: "Ze New Order"
GNR_ze_new_order_desc: "Are you ready for ze new order? Be ready to give your rights away!\n\nOur task is clear and obvious - to create a true utopia where a person in an evil world will feel safe. Yes, we may have to monitor every step, and you won’t have any right to property. But we’ll make sure you’re only HAPPY about it; otherwise, alas, such a person won’t fit into the new formation of societal consciousness. Agenda 1980 will be fulfilled!"

ISS_nothing_ever_happens: "Nothing! Ever! Happens!"
ISS_nothing_ever_happens_desc: "Nothing ever happens - that’s our motto and way of life. Thanks to this, we can maintain absolute stability in our country. Of course, we could carry our banner further afield? But then we’d violate this principle.\n\nFollowers of our idea are right at the top of the metaverse! Soon the entire original world will be a model of boredom. If we lose here, we’ll win in the future!"

We, however, are in the exact opposite situation: we’re God-knows-where, in God-knows-what time. We’ve lost contact with Eastern Mesa; all that’s left is to settle here and figure out what’s going on."

BRL_i_have_no_values_desc: "Our ideas, our tasks, and our goals - it’s all bullshit. We need to act solely based on the situation.\n\nThere are no principles, no ideologies, only pure improvisation! Need to fight communists? We’ll become die-hard capitalists! Need to fight the left - we’ll be right-wing. Against the right - we’ll be left-wing. Of course, such 'mental flexibility' isn’t to everyone’s liking. But we have one universal response to these complaints - 'deal with it, dwarfs.'"

GCZ_greatest_union: "Greatest Union"
GCZ_greatest_union_desc: "We managed to achieve the impossible - reconciling Czechs and Germans. What couldn’t be resolved for decades was settled in mere days.

GWS_goodwill_soldiers_desc: "Occupation isn’t an easy task, especially when you’re controlling the lands of a sworn enemy. We were bound by all sorts of international laws, conventions, and U.S. regulations. Now that Washington refuses to talk to us, we’re ready to have some real fun. Soldiers have full freedom of action, while Afton will develop his entrepreneurial skills and expand a chain of pizzerias across Germany.\n\nMaybe someday they’ll come for us, but we’ve got an answer to any crimes against humanity: 'It doesn’t count if we had fun.'"

GRH_true_communism: "This Time It’ll Take Off!"
GRH_true_communism_desc: "Communism is the greatest ideology of our time. But not once have communist experiments led to anything good. However, that’s no longer the case - knowing the formula for true communism, we will build a genuine workers’ society! Heil Marx! Heil Engels!"

GAU_what_the_fuck_are_we: "What the Hell Are We?"
GAU_what_the_fuck_are_we_desc: "Being an extremely diverse coalition, we resolve any issue, even the smallest, collectively. This causes a lot of inconvenience - sometimes we simply can’t form a coherent agenda! Every council member has their own radical views; it’s an absolute nightmare."

DSH_far_from_home: "Far From Home"
DSH_far_from_home_desc: "Italian troops set foot on German soil after the Fritz suffered a crushing defeat in their attempt to seize Italy. Of course, not everyone shared the ideas of the communist Italian revolution, but everyone was ready to defend the Fatherland.\n\nBut the world has changed, and Italy is now completely different. All attempts to contact Rome have failed, as if someone is interfering. And now we’re alone, yet our faith in Italy hasn’t faded!"

GRA_grave_enemy: "Arch Enemy"
GRA_grave_enemy_desc: "Even in this strange world we ended up in without wanting to, that damned organization exists - CERN, damn it. Once again, they’ve meddled with time machine developments, so we’ll have to be ready to counter them anywhere."

GSU_research_zone: "Research Zone"
GSU_research_zone_desc: "The current task of the European Organization for Nuclear Research is to determine the causes of the ongoing universal anomaly. Our country feels more like a giant laboratory, a research subject. This makes it hard to maintain a fully functioning state. However, science demands sacrifices."

AGS_elons_vision: "Elon’s Vision"
AGS_elons_vision_desc: "Elon Musk always has fresh ideas popping into his head. No matter how absurd they might seem, he always manages to make them happen. The whole country is a little playground for Musk - he’s ready to do whatever his heart desires. And he’ll always find reasons why it’s a good idea."

OKL_allah_suryah_bashar: "Allah, Luxembourg, Bashar!"
OKL_allah_suryah_bashar_desc: "Bashar has already lost his country once; now he must not lose it a second time. He needs to act far more decisively and boldly so that every resident, regardless of anything, knows the three great words and remains loyal to them - 'Allah, Luxembourg, Bashar!'"

GBW_courts_of_ancap: "Courts in Ancap"
GBW_courts_of_ancap_desc: "The most complicated question in anarcho-capitalism is the judicial one. No one, absolutely no one, can figure out how private courts are supposed to work. How should they enforce their rulings? Which courts are higher, and which are lower? How the hell is anarcho-capitalism even supposed to function? These are all questions left unanswered. And probably, no one will ever solve them."

AUS_money_must_flow: "Money Must Flow!"
AUS_money_must_flow_desc: "To sustain the extremely ascetic life of a streamer, a large amount of money is required. Fortunately, even here there are sheikhs and simply caring people ready to donate their hard-earned cash to a great cause. An unspoken contract has formed between the population and the streamer - they give him money, and he gives them a show. Sounds pretty good, right?"

RMN_fragile_power: "Fragility of Power"
RMN_fragile_power_desc: "Padania itself was a developed province, and humans are such beasts that if you give them something, they’ll demand more. Having shelter and food, they now clamor about some rights, the restoration of Greco-style democracy. And then there’s this Yeshua preaching who-knows-what. Tough, tough..."

GHL_NAFO: "NAFO"
GHL_NAFO_desc: "North Atlantic Fella Organization - a new type of force, an informational one. Unlike regular soldiers, they psychologically influence people. They use the full arsenal of available media to achieve their set goals.\n\nAnd in the worst case, they can become soldiers too. Pretty mediocre ones, but they signed up for it themselves, didn’t they?"

accelerationism_madoka_cult_subtype_desc: "What Homura Akemi adheres to cannot be called an ideology in the classical sense. It is a list of goals and ideas followed by a single person on this planet, who suddenly found themselves in the middle of Germany.\n\nHer, if one can call it that, goal Homura considers to be the salvation of a certain 'Kaname Madoka.' Unfortunately, it’s impossible to understand who this is, whether it’s a person at all, or something else entirely. It’s hard to distinguish lies and rumors from the truth, but the one thing that can be understood about her is that she is ready to pursue her goal to the end. Even if it means sacrificing §ethe entire universe§!."
accelerationism_church_of_ring_subtype_desc: "The Church of the Ring is an unusual religious-political movement that emerged in Stuttgart amidst the ongoing chaos. At its core, it resembles Catholic Christianity, but it has undergone numerous metamorphoses.\n\nThe cult claims the existence of 'magical girls' - supernatural beings who, in exchange for fulfilling their wishes, became a sort of 'angels,' fighting against evil. The supreme 'God' is Kaname Madoka - the ultimate magical girl who became a pillar in the fate of the other girls.\n\nDespite the absurdity of such ideas, they quickly captured the minds of people in Stuttgart and its surroundings. The matriarch of the church, Akemi Homura, through her speeches and actions, solidified her power in a short time. Soldiers and magical girls loyal to her are ready to assist and support her endeavors.\n\n§GBut is this enough?§!"

Even the classics of anarchism could only cautiously hope for the realization of their ideas in reality (albeit a broken one), but how these ideas found practical application in reality, they could only imagine in their worst nightmares.\n\nThe regime of Mikhail Svetov, merged with the deity of pre-Christian mystical cults, the Invincible Sun, represents capitalism brought to its logical culmination: devoid of mercy just like the sun, which gives life but blinds anyone who stares at it too closely, Svetov has rejected the principle of non-violence, creating a realm of strength. Man is a hungry wolf to man, ready to devour his rival the moment he stumbles.\n\nHow courts function under anarcho-capitalism remains a mystery to the global community."
accelerationism_anarcho_etatism_svetov_subtype_desc: "Anarcho-etatism, also known as Dawn Libertarianism, is hard to call an ideology in any sense of the word. It is a tangle of contradictions, born of a broken reality and capable of existing only within it.\n\nMikhail Svetov, the avatar of the Invincible Sun, has reunited the ego of the solar logos with its shadow, embodied in Mikhail Pozharsky, becoming the embodiment of the Self and realizing the value of love. Now he must learn true mercy from his allies: Adolf Hitler, Muhammad al-Rayni, and Homura Akemi. His new regime will be entirely cleansed of capitalism’s cruelty, transforming the punishing fist of the market into the warm, loving touch of a Father, granting his love to both those who deserve it and those who do not.\n\nPerhaps in this quest, he will also discover how courts should function under anarcho-etatism."
accelerationism_anarcho_etatism_pozharskiy_subtype_desc: "Anarcho-etatism, also known as Lunar Libertarianism, is hard to call an ideology in any sense of the word. It is a tangle of contradictions, born of a broken reality and capable of existing only within it.\n\nWhen Mikhail Svetov absorbed the light of the Invincible Sun, he was forced to cast aside the shadow. That shadow became Mikhail Temnov, formerly known as Pozharsky. Anarcho-etatism is an ideology of harsh yet caring love. It postulates the existence of the state as a parental figure, protecting its children from the dangers of the outside world and themselves. The unworthy will find mercy in death, and the worthy - in boundless, cold love like moonlight.\n\nHow courts function under anarcho-etatism remains a mystery to the global community."

AprilFools_Akemi_Homura_DESC_actual: "Twelve years, a hundred cycles - that was the price I paid for a single goal: to save Madoka Kaname, my only friend and the person who matters to me. Due to Madoka's wish to save all magical girls from becoming witches, she ceased to exist within this world. I remained the only person who remembers her. My own wish - to save Madoka - remained unchanged. I am ready to commit any sin for her happiness. The Incubators' attempt to seize control of the 'Law of Cycles' failed, and I managed to break the cycle itself and rewrite the universe.\n\nOr did I? Instead of the universe I tried to create, I ended up here. In the middle of an incomprehensible world stitched together from barely logical fragments of cosmic fabric. Why? Why did all my efforts vanish into oblivion? Didn't I try to create a world where Madoka and the others could be happy? Is this the fate of the Devil - forbidden from creating paradise? My feelings have dulled, and I see no meaning... a terrible feeling...\n\nIn any case, I must face the truth. Madoka isn't here, and I doubt she could have entered my world. I'll have to survive here alone. But... I will do everything possible to find her and make her happy, no matter the cost."

Now only her final cycle's wish is known - to save all magical girls from becoming witches.\n\nAnd this wish truly worked... playing a cruel trick on her. At the cost of saving others, she completely erased herself from the fabric of the universe, becoming a sort of demigod.\n\nHomura's attempt to return Madoka to her normal state led to the current situation.

GWF_start_from_scratch_desc: "This... isn’t right. I was absolutely supposed to rewrite my universe. But this doesn’t even remotely resemble Mitakihara or anything familiar to me. Did something go wrong? But I planned everything so that...\n\nFor now, I shouldn’t overanalyze the situation.\n\nThe only thing that concerns me, and will continue to concern me, is Kaname Madoka and whether she’s okay. I should start by figuring out if she’s anywhere nearby. Only then can I begin planning my next steps.\n\n§RAll that’s left is to pray for the best§!"
GWF_asses_situation_desc: "The only thing I’ve managed to figure out so far: I can’t sense Madoka’s presence nearby, and I have absolutely no idea where I’ve ended up. The place I’m in looks like a European city, but it has a very strange and eerie atmosphere. The locals are acting extremely suspicious, even frightened.\n\nI don’t know the language, the city, or the people around me. I don’t even have any ideas about how to start acting in this situation. It feels like those old days when I was afraid to interact with people around me... it’s been a while since I last felt this way.\n\nRegardless, these difficulties shouldn’t stop me from gathering intel, especially since I’m not entirely confident in my conclusions."
GWF_to_find_exit_desc: "Upon arriving in this bizarre world, my mind was preoccupied with more pressing thoughts than whether I’m still a magical girl. How did I get here? What should I do? Where am I? - ever since the initial conditions became clear. Now it’s time to start working on escaping this place and achieving my ultimate goal.\n\nHowever, I need to know for certain what I’m capable of and what I’m not. What powers do I even have under my control? My shield seems to be intact, but beyond that, I don’t know much yet. In the near future, I’ll focus on testing myself. I hope the results of this analysis will be highly satisfactory; otherwise, everything will become much more complicated."
GWF_contact_incubator_desc: "The Incubator, also known as Kyubey, appears to be an unusual, cute little creature offering to grant any heartfelt wish in exchange for becoming a magical girl. But that’s only at first glance. In reality, they are the most despicable beings the universe has ever seen. Under the guise of their goal to 'save the universe from entropy,' the Incubators treat humans like cattle, disregarding their emotions. 'You agreed to this' is their pathetic excuse when you learn all the details and nuances of being a magical girl from them.\n\nBut despite all my hatred for them, they genuinely don’t know how to lie. Right now, the Incubators are an invaluable source of information about this world for me. Therefore, my current goal will be to find one of their kind. If these creatures are allowed to use humans for their purposes, why shouldn’t I turn the chessboard in my favor?"
GWF_look_inside_desc: "Kyubey is telling me strange things based on his 'information.' Apparently, I’m the leader of this city and its surroundings. I’m not inclined to trust this creature, but there’s always a chance to verify it since I have nothing to lose.\n\nBut what should I do if all the power is truly in my hands? I don’t really understand politics or state governance. The role of a leader of an entire country feels overwhelming, even frightening. Won’t this turn into a burden that only pulls me further from what I truly need? I won’t get ahead of myself; I should start small - confirm the alien’s words."
GWF_only_my_struggle_desc: "What does it mean to govern a state? It feels like driving a car with broken brakes hurtling toward a cliff. If the fall is inevitable, why not have more opportunities to jump out? I see no reason to care about the 'gifted' territory I’ve been handed.\n\nSo no, I won’t relinquish my authority. There are still plenty of enemies in this country, and my magical abilities won’t instantly eliminate tens, maybe even hundreds of thousands, of those who want my head. I might even do something, but definitely not for the good of this farce. This isn’t my battlefield, and it won’t become one, not now."
GWF_humanity_aside_desc: "Even though I’ve abandoned most of my duties, in the public consciousness, I’m still the leader, monarch, chief, führer. Aside from the resistance, most of the population supports me for now. To prevent my enemies from gaining strength, I think it’s worth instilling fear of me in them. Public executions of the most ardent state criminals, raids on neighborhoods where opposition cells have been spotted - they should fear me and not even dare to think of resisting.\n\nAnd the people? I only care about the fate of one person, and I still have to find her. Once I’m done, I’ll set the universe back on its proper course, and everything that happened will remain only in my memory."
GWF_controllable_chaos_desc: "Having abandoned most of the leadership, the bureaucrats still consider me their leader and keep bringing me documents and decrees. It seems they don’t immediately grasp what’s going on. Disbanding these incompetents would solve it once and for all.\n\nI think the most sensible decision for me is to let the country drift into 'free sailing,' leaving people to fend for themselves. To me, this is nothing more than a foolish game I’ve been dragged into against my will. So I’ll remain an observer in this hellish game. The only thing left for me as a leader is to ensure this chaos doesn’t threaten me or my sole goal."
GWF_security_forces_desc: "It turns out there are 'Security Forces' in the country, something akin to a state secret police. They don’t seem to be a model of efficiency right now, as even in guerrilla warfare conditions, I have to rely on army remnants and myself. This issue needs to be addressed somehow.\n\nForming squads of loyal thugs who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty would be ideal. I can’t take down all my enemies single-handedly, but with even a couple thousand such 'soldiers,' there shouldn’t be any obstacles. They say something like that existed before - 'Schutzstaffel,' was it?"
GWF_one_cant_do_all_the_job_desc: "Governing a country isn’t an easy task? But who said it would ever be simple? Still, being the sole ruler of a nation isn’t what I need. I should start looking for people who know more about what a state is. I’ll retain a wide range of powers, but the bureaucrats will handle most of the work themselves.\n\nWho knows, maybe this is some kind of test, or perhaps the universe is just mocking me. But if I manage to bring order to the region, it’ll likely make pursuing my own goal much easier. I hope so."
GWF_administrative_business_desc: "Though the so-called parliament has been restored, I remain the leader of Württemberg. To some extent, I’ll have to delve into the nuances of state governance, whether I like it or not. Attend a couple of parliamentary sessions, listen to what the statesmen in colorful jackets have to say, nod wisely a few times, and sign a paper - it sounds simple enough.\n\nBut if this actually starts improving the situation, then why not? After all, finding a needle in a haystack is easier if the hay’s been sorted beforehand. The key is not to miss that needle while sorting the hay..."
GWF_church_of_ring_desc: "A state isn’t just a governing apparatus, bureaucrats, parliament, and all that mess - it’s also an ideology, something that makes people feel loyal to the ruler and understand why they should die for their Fatherland. After nearly half a century of Nazi rule, it’s worth reinventing the state idea to once again have a unifying backbone.\n\nThe foundation of the new state will be a religious ideology where I’ll be both matriarch and leader. Taking the Catholicism I’m familiar with as a base, I’ll add a mix of magical girls, state-building, and, of course, the law of cycles. Behind the facade, there are more self-serving goals, turning the search for Madoka from a personal quest into a public one."
GWF_support_from_outside_desc: "Heated debates are raging in the Stuttgart parliament. What to do with the proliferating resistance groups? Some propose harsh suppression, others a compromise. Eventually, the discussion reached the point of asking for my stance. If my opinion matters so much to them, then fine.\n\nCommunists, nationalists, democrats - honestly, what’s the difference? If they want to govern the country after I achieve what I need, that’s their right. Once I restore my universe, they’ll be nothing but memories, so it’s irrelevant. The main thing is that they lay down their arms and don’t interfere."
GWF_operation_umbra_desc: "Be that as it may, the current uncontrollable state of affairs is hindering my tasks. It’s hard to say what could solve these problems here and now, but it’s worth trying to find a solution. Though I’m the leader of this 'country,' I could try to 'inspire' the local population.\n\nPerhaps it’d be a good idea to deliver an uplifting speech to the people. I’ll have to step out of my comfort zone and prepare a public address. I hope it’s a good idea. If successful, it could resolve most of the issues at once, but if not... I’ll have to try harder."
GWF_my_own_realm_desc: "Well, during the time I’ve led this state, something has come of it. I don’t know how good or bad it turned out. The most important thing for me is that this unclear role of ruler doesn’t become too much of a burden or distract me from saving Madoka. Whether some hate me more or others deify me, I don’t care.\n\nI should take a walk around the city, perhaps. See the result of my efforts, whatever it may be. Nothing can be changed here anyway; sooner or later, it’ll all just remain a strange misunderstanding."
GWF_look_outside_desc: "Apparently, besides me, there are plenty of other 'lucky ones' who’ve been dragged into this world. I don’t know this world well, so I should ask Kyubey to find out about everything around me, whatever it might be. In any case, I need to be informed about the situation surrounding me. Obviously, the borders of 'my' kingdom end somewhere.\n\nMaybe I’ll find some allies, or perhaps enemies I’ll need to destroy. But it feels like I’m sitting on a giant powder keg right now, so I definitely can’t stay on the sidelines, no matter how much I’d prefer to. Time to look at the chessboard."
GWF_visit_vienna_desc: "One of the potential allies Kyubey mentioned is the so-called 'Vienna Polycommune' - a union of people connected by nothing except living near each other in the early twentieth century. They all have wildly opposing views on almost everything, making it hard to even figure out how to approach them.\n\nFrom the description, it seems to me that turning them into allies will be far from easy. But even so, I need to try. Despite their quirks, they should make decent allies, at least according to the alien cat."
GWF_attack_italians_desc: "As I’ve discovered, the main problem for the Vienna government is a large military group to their south. These are forces of the Italian Empire that came out of nowhere, though they have no connection to Rome. They’re led by some officer from Libya.\n\nDespite supply issues, lack of contact with the mainland, and a rather shaky position, these Italians still pose a serious threat to our new ally. That’s why I’ll pay them a little 'visit' to temporarily undermine their combat capability. The strike might not be too significant, but they’ll still have to spend time recovering."
GWF_union_of_samefaced_desc: "To the west of Württemberg, a certain resistance has seized power. Fortunately, it’s not resistance against me. They oppose an organization based in Geneva. I don’t want to dig into the roots of their enmity, and they’re not particularly well-known anyway. What matters more to me is another fact.\n\nTheir leader is a certain Suzuha Amane. From Kyubey’s brief description, she’s also an outsider. Her original world might not be much like mine, but we should still find common ground - even if I won’t mention that I (conveniently) suddenly learned the language perfectly."
GWF_can_cern_answer_desc: "After the Resistance became our ally, some details about their main rival emerged. CERN - a scientific organization that seized power in their world, but somehow both they and the Resistance ended up here. They’re still researching and developing time machines and teleportation.\n\nGiven that I ended up here through time and space against my will, maybe these eggheads have some coherent studies on the matter. Even if it doesn’t bring me closer to finding Madoka, at least I’ll help an ally. Preemptively weakening the enemy’s combat ability will make things much easier."
GWF_unholy_alliance_desc: "On the outskirts of Speer’s domain, there’s a small country deeply hostile to them. As I understand it, it’s also run by outsiders. But dealing with them will be trickier. Their leader, Bashar Assad, had to flee his country in his own world and somehow ended up here, making contact with him extremely difficult.\n\nEven so, they’re a significant thorn in Speer’s side, so it’s worth trying to win them over to my side. Even if I’m not particularly thrilled about it."
GWF_redbus_luxembourg_desc: "During discussions with Luxembourg’s leadership, they came up with the idea of deporting all disloyal elements from Frankfurt. At first glance, it sounds foolish, but it might work. In theory, it should look like a good deal for Speer - he gets rid of various rebels, and in Luxembourg, they’ll tear each other apart.\n\nMeanwhile, Luxembourg gains tens of thousands of motivated fighters, and any disorganization issues can be resolved quickly. So the advantage definitely won’t be on Frankfurt’s side."
GWF_stuttgart_convention_desc: "Well, at least the first allies have been gathered. Now I’ll invite delegations from across Southern Germany to a coalition conference. It’s time to settle some matters and define our prospects and capabilities."
GWF_operations_in_bavaria_desc: "Bavaria is currently the largest country in the region. Despite their... bizarre ideology, they remain a key player. Depending on their attitude toward us, I’ll take steps to either weaken or bolster their military strength."
GWF_plan_b_desc: "A large coalition of allies is great, of course. But extra precautions won’t hurt. To prevent an enemy breakthrough into our territory, I’ll order the construction of a network of fortifications along the entire border."
GWF_look_at_powers_desc: "It’s not hard to guess that a strong army is the main argument for survival in this wild world. Surrounded by enemies on many sides, without troops, this country will become a punching bag. And I’ll turn into a target for countless thugs eager to claim the head of the 'former leader of their foes.'\n\nRight now, I should check the state of the local armed forces. Maybe I should make an unannounced visit to one of the military bases. My expectations are pretty low, though, so I should prepare to build an army from absolute scratch."
GWF_magical_girl_army_desc: "Magical girls have exceptional physical abilities and immense firepower. They could be used to create a full-fledged army to counter external threats. Of course, forming such a force will come with many challenges. Not every girl will want to sacrifice her wish and her life for the Fatherland. And they’ll need to be united into some kind of organized force.\n\nNaturally, using magical girls in a real war raises a lot of moral and practical questions. How will they perform in combat? How can organization be maintained in the army? And is it even ethical to use young girls as soldiers? Many questions remain unanswered. But one answer is clear: should human rights even apply to those who’ve ceased to be human?"
GWF_its_good_to_lie_desc: "The question arises of how to systematically and quickly recruit magical girls for the new army. Of course, I could hope for a miracle - that girls will join out of a sense of duty. But that approach is doomed to fail from the start, so it’s worth taking a risk and trying a highly unusual recruitment method that some might find vile and repugnant.\n\nThat method is good old propaganda. The machine built 40 years ago needs to start running again, but this time aimed at one specific group - future magical girls. Radio broadcasts, leaflets, films, personal speeches - all of this must now work toward building the army. I’ll have to use the methods of that hated little creature, but there’s no other way."
GWF_control_witch_problem_desc: "A witch is the final role of a magical girl in this world. A being that embodies grief and despair, destined to kill and wreak havoc until it’s slain by another magical girl. Telling the full truth about soul gems and witches would be like shooting myself in the head and dismantling the army in a single day. So, such facts should be left 'outside the brackets' of military service conditions.\n\nBut the issue of turning into witches remains. I’ll introduce measures to conceal this fact from ordinary soldiers’ eyes. From destroying dark gems to handing over such magical girls to cleanup squads that will kill fresh witches to harvest grief seeds. After all, sources to restore the vitality of the rest of the troops are still needed. It may sound incredibly cruel and unfair, but such is life."
GWF_inarmy_concurention_desc: "Every army needs its 'standout' soldiers who can become the backbone of the officer corps, elite units, and so on. To most effectively produce such warriors, it’s worth fostering a spirit of competition and rivalry within the army. I might even introduce full-on duels and battles as a way to settle who’s right and who’s wrong.\n\nBalancing a competitive spirit with teamwork won’t be easy, but somehow the wheat needs to be separated from the chaff in peacetime. A little Spartanism won’t hurt."
GWF_human_army_desc: "In contrast to my idea of creating an army of magical girls, I’ll opt for forming classic troops made up of ordinary humans. The idea of a magical army sounds tempting, but the potential downsides of forming such a force outweigh any benefits.\n\nFortunately or unfortunately, I can’t handle the creation of a human army myself, so I need to start setting up a general staff and hiring some old German officers who know far more about military matters than I do. I need to find those capable and willing to lead a multi-thousand-strong army."
GWF_play_from_shadows_desc: "As a magical girl, the world of military tactics, doctrines, and conventions is alien to me. It all looks too convoluted and strange. The generals still request my presence at military meetings, but among those who understand the intricacies of troop organization, I feel out of place.\n\nSo I’d prefer to leave all army-building questions to the newly assembled general staff, taking on a more ceremonial and advisory role in this complex mechanism. Formally, I’ll remain the commander-in-chief as the country’s leader, but the real leadership of the army will rest with the field marshals and generals."
GWF_peoples_milita_desc: "In addition to forming a regular army, a proposal was made to create less organized, less trained, and less equipped troops that can be trained in a very short time. They’ll serve more of a support role and act as infantry for the 'darkest day.' Modeled after the former Volkssturm, the Württemberg People’s Militia will be established.\n\nRelaxed recruitment requirements and rapid training will allow us to deploy a larger number of units immediately. I hope this idea works as intended."
GWF_from_shit_and_sticks_desc: "An army isn’t just people ready to fight and officers leading them. They also need something to fight with. Weapons, artillery, equipment, uniforms - the bare minimum for forming a modern army. However, with a large number of troops comes the problem of supplying them with everything they need.\n\nWürttemberg’s small industry can’t keep up with the current rearmament demands. As a result, the general staff proposed lowering weapon production standards and allowing small workshops to supply the army as well. Obviously, this will reduce the quality of the weapons. But a lot of bad weapons today is far better than a little good weaponry tomorrow."
GWF_operation_rapinam_desc: "The issue of arming the army is quite pressing. A shortage of quality weapons could lead to dire consequences in the future. There are many ways to address this, but I have one particularly good idea.\n\nI should use my magical abilities to solve this problem for the army. Drawing on my old experience of 'borrowing' weapons from the Self-Defense Forces, I’ll visit large warehouses beyond this country’s borders. With time-stopping and the vast pocket space inside my shield, it seems I could achieve great success in personally supplying the army with everything it needs."
GWF_hounds_pack_desc: "It’s time to assess the results of these brief military reforms. Have I managed to create a fully functional army in just six months, or is it all just smoke and mirrors? Were all the efforts worth it? Right now, the only way to find out is to hold full-scale military exercises to test the troops’ combat readiness and ability to carry out assigned tasks.\n\nThe exercises will last a couple of weeks and consist of a wide range of goals and objectives. Every combat-ready part of the army must go through these trials, or else it was all for nothing."
GWF_operation_occasus_desc: "Everything is ready. Allies are assembled, the army is formed, and state matters are more or less resolved. Now it’s time to tackle the main problem - eliminating external enemies. We’ll launch a preemptive strike on Frankfurt and its allies’ positions. There’s no turning back now, only forward."

GWF_our_time_has_come_desc: "Well, the war has begun. It’s time to settle all scores with my enemies on the battlefield. The results of nearly two years of preparation will become glaringly obvious, exposing every small crack and flaw in the structure of our enemies and allies. To keep the whole thing from collapsing, we need to crush them quickly.\n\nOf course, Speer and his gang will throw everything they can into the furnace of war. But their plans for a 'German Jihad' are doomed to fail. No matter how hard they try, they can’t win - of that I’m certain. Victory will be mine, and mine alone."
GWF_embrace_troops_desc: "The main argument in any war is, obviously, a large and motivated army. If I can’t maintain morale among the soldiers, no amount of cutting-edge weapons or numbers will matter.\n\nI’ll have to become a sort of 'commissar' for my entire army. Traveling from front to front, I’ll boost the troops’ fighting spirit. In the worst case, I’ll resort to forceful methods to raise morale. The most important thing is victory."
GWF_allies_help_desc: "The enemy of my enemy is my friend. That’s roughly the logic behind the current coalition of the Stuttgart government with other regional fragments. Unity within such a diverse group is crucial right now. Appropriate decisions must be made to maintain this cohesion.\n\nBut of course, I shouldn’t forget that they have obligations too. I’ll request shipments of necessary weapons from them. They likely won’t be able to provide large volumes, but that equipment will be far more useful in my hands than in theirs."
GWF_sabotage_enemies_desc: "We mustn’t forget that working behind enemy lines is also part of the effort for victory. If we can undermine the enemy’s combat ability from within, the war will become much easier. I’ll send specially trained agents to disrupt the enemy’s troop logistics.\n\nIt won’t do without some personal intervention either - my time-stopping ability is perfect for such operations. Unlucky guards and soldiers won’t even realize that something’s about to explode or that part of their arsenal will vanish from the warehouses."
GWF_expand_industry_desc: "Developing military industry in peacetime is far harder than during a war. Questions like 'Why?' or 'Why not for the people?' always arise. When it’s a fight for the nation’s survival, people are much more willing to work for the Fatherland. Leveraging this, the country’s entire industry will start laboring to arm the army."
GWF_carrot_and_stick_desc: "Eventually, the stream of eager volunteers will dry up, and we’ll have to turn to alternative methods to replenish the army. If people won’t join willingly, we’ll need to entice them with privileges, monetary rewards, and empty words about status and honor.\n\nAlong with the carrot, there’ll be a stick. Intensified crackdowns on draft dodgers, lowered selection criteria, and harsh punishments for evasion. The combination of these methods should bolster the army’s numbers."
GWF_capital_attacks_desc: "The enemy’s main headquarters is always its capital. To break their spirit and destroy their decision-making centers, we should launch a campaign of massive bombings. Cities reduced to dust are a small price for victory, and the costs of rebuilding those territories won’t be my concern. Let the earth burn, let the enemy’s cities blaze!\n\nAs if they deserve mercy?"
GWF_work_or_die_desc: "This isn’t enough - it’s never been enough! To fully meet all armament needs, factories must operate beyond their capacity. Twelve-hour shifts? No, round-the-clock production should become the norm. People must give themselves entirely to this victory; in the rear, all life must be directed solely toward the war.\n\nIf they don’t want to, we’ll have to work on them a little. No one said there’s a choice - you either work, or you work in worse conditions. Mines, quarries, and rubble cleanup could use some hands too. And the Security Forces will ensure no discontent arises."
GWF_personal_involvement_desc: "The situation turned out... trickier than I thought. A quick victory didn’t happen, and the small magical girl army isn’t showing any significant success. At this rate, it won’t be long before a real defeat. That can’t be allowed under any circumstances, even if avoiding defeat comes at a steep price.\n\nIf someone can’t do the task you set, do it yourself. I’ll have to take that approach and become a one-person army. A miracle will appear on the fronts, slaying hundreds and thousands of enemy soldiers in an instant. Unfortunately, this will drain me immensely. But what choice do I have?"
GWF_total_mobilisation_desc: "The situation on the front is growing worse by the day. A quick war has turned into a prolonged meat grinder, and the army is gradually wearing itself down. Now, even conscripts aren’t enough to replenish it, let alone volunteers. Of course, there’s an idea to solve this, even if it makes me despised.\n\nThat solution is forced mobilization. Any man over sixteen can easily hold a weapon and perform basic combat tasks. Two arms, two legs, two eyes, and an intact head - no further criteria are needed. Military recruiters will be tasked with drafting as many soldiers as possible, no matter the cost."
GWF_release_witches_desc: "For a swift victory, I need to stop holding back with any notions of decency, war norms, or other conventions. If the enemy won’t surrender quickly, I’ll force them into the most comprehensive capitulation a defeated foe could theoretically accept.\n\nAs a weapon of mass destruction, I can use former magical girls. Grief seeds are an excellent choice for both psychotronic and conventional warfare. Imagine the terror of an uninitiated person, stuck in a trench, suddenly thrust into an abstract world where everything wants to kill them. Yes, I’ll have to compromise even my own principles for this, but if it’s for a greater goal, why not?"
GWF_second_sun_desc: "To deal the enemy the most devastating blow, I should forget about moral norms and dilemmas. Rules of war, honor, principles? Nonsense! The end always justifies the means, no matter what they are. And the means I’ll use are highly specific and meant only for war.\n\nBack from the time before I arrived in this strange world, Germany still has sizable stockpiles of nuclear weapons of varying yields. So why not use them as intended? If necessary, let everything burn!"
GWF_great_betrayal_desc: "[GET_GWF_GREAT_BETRAYAL_DESC]"
GWF_great_betrayal_desc_evil: "What can be called victory? What I’ve achieved now isn’t victory - at best, it’s half of it. Betrayal is, I’d say, too harsh a word. I never swore loyalty to my so-called 'allies.' I’m sure that the moment they get a chance to stab me in the back, they’ll take it. This is just a preemptive move - they must fall by my hand first.\n\nA grand ceremony in Stuttgart’s town hall will be a fitting signal for the true end of this war. They all must come and enjoy my hospitality. Fine food, wine - and they shouldn’t mind the soldiers at the walls. Let this celebration be the last in their miserable lives. No one must stand in the way of my goal. No one."
GWF_great_betrayal_desc_not_evil: "Well, victory has been won in the war. But can this be considered the end of conflicts? No, not at all. Though the coalition still exists, it’s only a matter of time before the first contradictions arise. Betrayal? You could call it that, but I’d prefer the term 'forceful resolution of disputes.' It’s better to pacify them now than get dragged into another war.\n\nAnother coalition conference will be convened in Stuttgart’s town hall. I’ll give them time to argue among themselves, then deliver an ultimatum for submission. To ensure my credibility, army units will preemptively take positions to completely paralyze any functions of the allied nations. I hope they’ll quickly grasp the situation and it’ll end without bloodshed."

GWF_burned_field_desc: "The war is over, truly over now. The main external and internal enemies have been crushed. I am now the sole queen of a vast territory stretching from the Mediterranean to Thuringia. For an ordinary person, this would be cause for celebration - after all, reuniting all of Germany isn’t far off. But... I have no reason to rejoice. And I won’t anytime soon.\n\nMadoka... I still can’t find her. Though no one hinders my search now, there’s not a single trace, not a single clue. I keep hoping for the best; she’ll surely turn up soon. I didn’t go through all this for nothing. Soon, I’ll definitely set everything right. Ha-ha, I still have a bit of work to do here, but I’ll absolutely achieve my goal."
GWF_end_the_surviours_desc: "Yes, the enemies are defeated, but their vile ideology lingers. It saturates the cities, the streets, the people. In Frankfurt or Zurich, you can easily overhear talk of the 'old regime' and 'why we lost.' It seems they need a reminder of who’s in charge now. I won’t tolerate anyone standing in my way - my patience has run out.\n\nThe harshest administrators will be sent to the 'liberated' territories. They’ll handle the dirty work of rooting out such thoughts from these idiots’ heads. They’ll have free rein to use any means necessary - prisons, labor camps, punitive squads, bullets to the head. These petty obstacles cannot be allowed to grow."
GWF_close_the_curtains_desc: "Since the unification of Southern Germany, outside attention has increased exponentially. Though I don’t know much about the state of the world beyond this chaos-ridden land, I don’t need extra eyes on me either. The territory I control must become a black spot for foreign intelligence, radio enthusiasts, and overly curious individuals. They must know nothing about who I am or what’s happening here.\n\nYes, this might harm 'international relations' or 'economic development' in the future. But I don’t care much about this universe or its fate. I won’t stop telling myself that no one must interfere with my search for Madoka."
GWF_prepare_everything_desc: "It seems this is far from the end. I still have many 'final touches' to handle before I can fully dedicate myself to finding Madoka. My domain resembles a burning dumpster more than anything organized. Even if that organization represents chaos, achieving my goal will be extremely difficult unless I resort to radical solutions. Of course, these could be positive or negative for the people.\n\nFor me, it’s not particularly important - there’s no logic here beyond achieving my goal. However, it’s time to consider what exactly these radical solutions should entail so they don’t backfire on me."
GWF_end_the_unloyal_desc: "There are still those who doubt my authority. It’s time to settle this matter once and for all, one way or another. How I do it will depend on how I’ve acted before."
GWF_subdue_the_useful_desc: "Yes, various people oppose me, but not all of them can be called useless. Among them are skilled fighters, scientists, administrators. If I can redirect their abilities to serve my purposes, it’ll be a major step toward the end.\n\nOf course, they’ll have no freedom. Every such individual will be placed under the strictest control to ensure they don’t even think of sabotaging or harming my cause. The Security Forces must handle all these people. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer - but I have no friends here, so everyone must be kept on a short leash."
GWF_useless_instruments_desc: "The army, bureaucrats, secret services - they’re all part of the grand spectacle I’ve built. The moment has come to decide what happens next. Will I continue as the director of this theater, or will I personally tear it down?"
GWF_incubator_free_zone_desc: "Incubators are loathsome creatures I despise. Of course, I’ve recently worked with them since they provided valuable information and services. But sooner or later, our paths had to diverge. I’ll tear up this 'contract' with the aliens; my new task will be to destroy as many of them as possible.\n\nThe question remains: how can I eliminate them all on my own? The Incubators themselves will help me with this. A few leading questions will be my hook to extract all the information I need about their vulnerabilities. Let these aliens weave the rope they’ll each hang from. They certainly deserve it."
GWF_total_expansion_desc: "I control only a part of Germany, which greatly complicates my search. A fairly powerful force has already formed in the north, one that could easily threaten me and my goals. I won’t tolerate their existence for long - they’re a massive obstacle that must be removed by any means necessary. I shouldn’t shy away from even dubious methods to defeat them.\n\nYes, this likely means another war, but unlike the last conflict, the battlefield will now be the rest of Germany. Expanding my domain as far as Bergen should make the search for Madoka much, much easier."
GWF_my_own_universe_desc: "Now, a vast and diverse territory lies under my heel. I didn’t immediately realize that managing a small city and its outskirts isn’t the same as controlling a former superpower. Many things will now have to be done entirely differently, or this whole structure will collapse inward and bury any of my aspirations.\n\nPerhaps I should reflect on my past decisions to prepare for any scenario. Breaking is easier than building, of course. But even so, I can’t afford to lose such opportunities until I’ve achieved my goal. From now on, Germany will definitely feel the presence of my leadership, whatever form it takes."
GWF_break_the_celling_desc: "Germany is useless. I’m absolutely certain I need to expand my search area, no matter the cost. I’m even willing to risk leaving the anomalous zone. If I succeed, I’ll search for Madoka across the entire world. No matter what, I’ll find her... I’ll head west first - yes, a good idea. I’ll start with the nearest 'non-zone' territories; it’ll be a solid beginning for a new search. If only this would make a difference..."
GWF_search_everywhere_desc: "Idiots, useless idiots! I can’t search for Madoka across this vast territory alone, so I tasked the Security Forces with it, but they haven’t come close to cracking the case. Why do they even bother eating their bread? They need to find something, not just churn out empty reports in bland bureaucratic jargon. The order is now this: let them search wherever they want, but if they fail to find her, the consequences will be severe."
GWF_this_isnt_working_desc: "Where, where is she? Why can’t I find her yet! I’m doing everything I can for this, but I’m not even close to knowing where Madoka is. Why..."

#ИВЕНТЫ 

GWF.1.t: "Loneliness at the Heights"
GWF.1.desc: "The cold wind whistled in her ears, tugging at the black ribbons in Homura's hair. She sat on the edge of a skyscraper's roof, her legs dangling over the void, her gaze sliding across the chaotic lights of an unfamiliar city. Signs in an unknown language, cars resembling steel beetles, people in strange coats—everything felt alien. Even the air smelled different: a mix of gasoline, rain, and something metallic.\n\n'Why?'—the thought spun in her head like a broken record. She clenched her fists, feeling the rough concrete beneath her gloves. The memories before she ended up here were hazy: a burst of light, Madoka's 'disruption,' and then... emptiness. Not a witch's labyrinth, not the familiar streets of Mitakihara. An alien city. An alien reality.\n\n- Madoka...—her voice was lost in the wind.\n\nShe closed her eyes, trying to picture her friend's smile, but instead saw cracks in the walls of her soul, fragments of her own promises: 'I'll save you, no matter the cost.' Now even that seemed like a mockery. She had changed the rules, rewritten reality, but instead of control, she got a cage.\n\nSomewhere below, a siren wailed, and Homura instinctively grabbed her bow. No Witches. No Familiars. Just the noise of a metropolis that felt too loud, and for a moment, Homura wondered if this was a hallucination. Or perhaps a dying vision, and she had ended up in some kind of hell or purgatory?\n\n- You broke everything,—Homura said to herself, standing up.\n\nGravel crunched under her feet. The city below lived its own life: people strolled along the embankment, an old man fed pigeons, a child chased a ball. Everything seemed utterly ordinary, yet a strange tension lingered in the air. Still, no one looked up. No one saw the girl in a black-and-white dress, ready to leap into the abyss.\n\n- What if I disappear,—she stepped to the very edge,—will anything change?"
GWF.1.a: "Eternal Fall"

GWF.2.t: "Abilities and Possibilities"
GWF.2.desc: "Several weeks had already passed since Homura found herself in this strange, absurd reality. Even her limited knowledge of history made it clear that this wasn't just a trip to the past. Red flags with hooked crosses shouldn't be flying in Europe in the 1970s, so this must be some kind of parallel reality. Of course, she couldn't act with certainty, which was why she kept an extremely low profile.\n\nStill, staying hidden wasn't always possible, and she occasionally caught the attention of locals. And then, another oddity. The people who noticed her suddenly began acting extremely deferential and respectful. She didn't understand the reason for their behavior, so she decided to shelve those thoughts for later.\n\nRight now, Homura was in a small forest outside the city. Clutching her Soul Gem, she transformed into her magical form and twisted her shield. Time froze. Drawing the recently acquired HK G3 rifle from behind the shield, she fired several bullets. Almost immediately after leaving the barrel, they froze mid-air.\n\n- No issues here,—Homura muttered, returning the shield to its normal position.\n\nThen, the Bow of Memory materialized in her hand—her primary weapon instead of the shield after the first universe reset. Drawing the bowstring, the arrow pierced the already bullet-riddled tree.\n\n- All my abilities remain intact... I'll keep the bow as a last resort,—she concluded.\n\nThe gentle night breeze brushed against Homura's face as she gazed at the starry sky. After standing there for a few more minutes, she headed back to the city."

GWF.3.t: "Hunting the Beast"
GWF.3.desc: "The industrial district. Gray factory buildings stretched along the river like colossal tombs. Smoke from the chimneys blended with low-hanging clouds, staining the sky a dirty leaden hue. Homura walked along the rusted rails, her boots thudding dully against the sleepers. Three weeks. Three weeks of patrols, ambushes, empty basements, and attics. The city seemed to swallow all traces of Kyubey, leaving only hints: scratches on concrete, tufts of white fur on barbed wire, the faint scent of ozone in the air.\n\nShe stopped near an abandoned warehouse. The walls were covered in graffiti—names, dates, meaningless symbols. A lock hung on the rusted door, but the chain had been bitten through. Inside, the air reeked of machine oil and mold. The flashlight beam revealed piles of crates, tangled wires, shattered glass. And—movement. A fleeting shadow, a rustle like silk against concrete.\n\nShe moved along the shelves, slowing her breath. Every step echoed. Suddenly, the light caught a white flicker—Kyubey sat on a pipe near the ceiling, its pink eyes gleaming in the dimness.\n\n- You won't escape,—she said, but the creature had already leaped into a ventilation shaft.\n\nHomura chased after it, scrambling up a ladder. The shaft led to the roof, where the wind tore the smoke into tatters. Kyubey ran along the parapet without looking back. She followed, jumping over gaps in the roofing, sliding across tin sheets. The chase led them into a maze of pipes and tanks.\n\nKyubey ducked into a narrow passage between two storage tanks. Homura slowed, pressing against the cold metal. Silence. Only droplets of condensation tapped against the steel.\n\nDrawing one of her 'Walthers,' she took precise aim at the creature's paw. A clean shot was crucial—if she killed it, it would just escape again. At that moment, Kyubey was already at the edge of the water tower. A shot rang out. A perfect hit. The white cat froze mid-movement, staying exactly where it was.\n\n- Got you...,—Homura grabbed it.\n\nThe creature twitched, trying to break free, but it was clearly over. Homura stepped closer, studying her enemy. Kyubey's eyes narrowed—not fear, but calculation.\n\n- Now you'll talk,—she whispered."

GWF.4.t: "Sovereign"
GWF.4.desc: "- Are you saying they consider me the leader of these lands?—Homura asked in surprise, glancing at the fidgeting cat beside her.\n\n- According to our data, yes. Everything is exactly as I told you—you are recognized as the ruler here,—Kyubey replied.\n\n- Hmm, Kyubey, what am I supposed to do with this information?—the magical girl asked pointedly.\n\n- At the very least, you undoubtedly have the authority to do whatever you wish,—the alien answered.\n\n- Fine, I’ll try to process this,—Homura muttered into the void, ignoring Kyubey.\n\nThe sky began to blush crimson, signaling the start of a normal person’s workday. The city hall was likely already open, so Homura decided to test Kyubey’s theory about her being in charge firsthand. Twenty minutes later, she stood in the main square before the city hall—a Gothic building with a clock tower at its center.\n\n- Let’s hope this goes well,—Homura said to herself as she approached the door.\n\nAfter she knocked, a man in military uniform immediately emerged, his expression a mix of agitation and bewilderment.\n\n- Akemi-sama, welcome to your residence. The staff is at your service,—the guard answered in a trembling voice.\n\n- Good, thank you,—Homura replied, stepping inside carefully.—Escort me to my office. The response lifted a weight off her shoulders. Kyubey’s theory had proven correct, sparing her an extremely awkward situation.\n\nAs she walked deeper into the city hall, clerks bowed respectfully to the magical girl passing through the corridor. Following the guard like a guide, she took in the Gothic building’s interior—lofty vaulted ceilings, dim lighting, an atmosphere steeped in bureaucracy and Nazi symbolism. At some point, the tension in Homura’s chest eased, replaced by the surreal realization that she was, in fact, the one in charge here.\n\n- We’ve arrived,—the guard’s voice interrupted her thoughts.—Is there anything else you require?\n\n- No, thank you. Return to your duties,—Homura dismissed him.\n\n- Yes, ma’am!—came the crisp reply as the soldier marched back to the entrance.\n\nOpening the door, Homura was met with a spacious office overlooking the city square. It was nearly empty, as if deliberately kept sterile for its ruler. Slowly circling the room, she finally stopped by the window."

GWF.5.desc: "Homura sat at her office desk. Piles of documents lay before her—reports, memos, decrees. Each was trivial in isolation, but as the leader, reading and acting on them was her duty. It was exhausting. She barely saw the point. So much time had passed, yet she hadn’t advanced an inch toward her true goal—finding and, if necessary, saving Madoka.\n\nA knock came at the door. Probably another clerk delivering more correspondence. Just as expected: more papers, more folders, more decrees. This continued until evening, when the staff finally left the city hall, save for a few guards.\n\nThe girl glanced out the window at the glowing nightscape—cars gliding down roads, people strolling carelessly across the square. She’d long since stopped understanding simple human joys. A decade trapped in the cycle, repeated failures persisting even now. It was unbearable. And now these... obligations.\n\nSuddenly, a creature materialized beside her. Even in the dark, his identity was unmistakable.\n\n- What do you want, Kyubey?—Homura asked.\n\n- You seem deeply dissatisfied with your current situation. Perhaps you should leverage your authority to achieve your goals?—Kyubey suggested.\n\n- Nonsense. No one could comprehend even a fraction of what’s happening,—Homura snapped.—It’s meaningless.\n\nThen, as if struck by a fresh idea, she abruptly sat down, grabbed a pen and a blank sheet, and began writing. Line after line filled the page until not a space remained.\n\n- Now, no one will interfere,—she muttered, lifting the paper to review her own words."

GWF.6.t: "Attack Dogs"
GWF.6.desc: "Sitting in her office, Homura sank into thought again. True, she’d rejected full-scale governance, but at this rate, her life would be at the mercy of rival factions. An idea formed: seizing direct control over a military-police unit. They’d need to be expendable thugs, cannon fodder for the dirtiest tasks. After drafting a decree to expand the 'Security Forces'—answering only to her—the recruitment question remained. She swiftly requested all data on Stuttgart-aligned forces. By the next day, everything was ready.\n\n- Akemi-sama, here’s the report on our available police units,—a clerk handed her a slim folder.\n\n- Thank you. That was quick. Dismissed,—Homura replied, taking the folder.\n\nLocking the office, she strode to her desk, now cleared of everything but blank sheets. Decrees, laws, and reports were petty bureaucrats’ work—let them handle the country. Her goal was entirely different, and governing had no place in it. Opening the folder, she began scanning the documents. They detailed every loyal police officer and special agent who’d stayed in Württemberg despite the chaos.\n\nHer eyes froze on a file titled 'Schutzstaffel Forces,' summarizing the organization’s history. 'Ruthless efficiency,' 'Unquestioning loyalty,' 'Ironclad discipline'—phrases that screamed exactly what Homura needed. Her task was to find those who could handle the grunt work she couldn’t (or wouldn’t) do herself. Their numbers were small—around a thousand—but more than enough.\n\nGrabbing a fresh sheet, she drafted an official order to the regional SS leader, 'Leibstandarte Heinrich Himmler' commander Wilhelm Mohnke. The reply arrived days later: he agreed to all terms and, as an oath, pledged to form the 'Leibstandarte Homura Akemi,' replacing what he called 'a brigade of toilet-selling degenerates.'"

Just as expected: more papers, more folders, more decrees. This continued until evening, when the staff finally left the city hall, save for a few guards.\n\nThe night passed in paperwork; morning arrived. By then, she’d only cleared half the documents. Slumping into her chair, Homura leaned back, ready to sleep—until another knock interrupted her. A bureaucrat entered with yet another stack of papers. She glared at him with undisguised disgust.\n\n- Forgive me, Akemi-sama, but are you displeased with something?—the man in a brown jacket asked, voice trembling slightly.\n\n- Yes, I’m displeased, and I’m tired of pretending otherwise. Why am I the only one expected to handle all this?—Homura snapped.\n\n- Akemi-sama, you yourself chose to govern this way,—the official cautiously countered.\n\n- *I* chose? Oh, for— She facepalmed, realizing this was a cosmic technicality. No one was truly to blame.\n\n- Well… there’s a faction in the government,—the man swallowed, fiddling with his jacket button,—advocating to reopen the parliament.\n\n- Interesting. Explain,—Homura said, genuine curiosity cutting through her fatigue.\n\nAfter glancing around, the bureaucrat detailed the reformist group within the government—himself included—pushing to restore civil administration and establish a full parliament in Württemberg. Half the terms he used flew over Homura’s head, but the core idea of *delegating* authority was clear. Without hesitation, she agreed to the plan, stunning the man. Within moments, her signature was drying on a fresh decree."

GWF.8.desc: "The city hall’s assembly chamber buzzed with preparations for drafting a constitution. Politicians from various parties took turns debating the draft’s merits, flaws, and the very timing of its proposal. As monotonous voices droned on, Homura—Stuttgart’s leader—nodded along out of politeness, her mind elsewhere.\n\nShe’d had no desire to attend this parliamentary session, seeing no purpose in her presence. Yet after relentless lobbying by lawmakers (‘If you’re absent, why even convene?’), she’d relented. Canceling it would’ve only delayed her true goals. So here she sat, enduring nearly ninety minutes of rotating speeches. *How did humans ever cooperate like this?* she wondered, recalling Kyubey’s musings on human emotions. Leadership, status—it all felt like the universe’s cruel joke. *Accidentally becoming a German warlord? Who’d believe that?*\n\nHer thoughts drifted to whether this compromise would derail her mission. The deeper she spiraled, the heavier her eyelids grew—until, unnoticed even by herself, she dozed off. Not that she’d have cared. Sleep was far more valuable than ‘listening to debates on the Constitutional Draft of the Kingdom of Württemberg.’"

GWF.9.t: "A Talk with the Father"
GWF.9.desc: "Homura sat on a pew in St. Elizabeth’s Church on the city’s west side. Workers bustled about, replacing stained glass and hanging new icons. Beside her, the parish priest observed the renovations in silence. Though reluctant to speak, Homura steeled herself and broke the quiet.\n\n- Father Konrad, forgive my bluntness, but… is what I’m doing blasphemy?—she asked.\n\n- You conceived this project, yet ask *me*? Still, my child, it’s a fair question,—the priest rubbed his chin.—All things have purpose. Even yours.\n\n- Perhaps. What becomes of someone who overthrows God… for His own good?—Homura mused aloud.\n\n- For His good? The Lord’s plan is inscrutable. Perhaps rebellion is part of it. Mortals cannot fathom Heaven’s designs,—Konrad replied calmly.\n\n- What if He *was* overthrown, but His throne stayed empty? What if this—*gesturing around*—is the result?—Homura pressed.\n\n- I shouldn’t say this, but… if God truly abandoned us, it *would* explain current events,—he chuckled softly.\n\n- Thank you, Father,—Homura nodded, ending the conversation.\n\nRenovations lasted till dusk. Homura interfered no further, content to watch in silence. By the end, the interior matched her vision exactly. Accepting a booklet of revised sermons, she left slowly, promising to attend Sunday service in the ‘renewed’ church.\n\nThat Sunday unfolded strangely. The congregation adapted to the new sermons as if anticipating them. Homura sat in the back row, unrecognizable. Attendance, the priest noted, was higher than ever. For once, Homura’s actions—however small—had borne fruit."

GWF.10.t: "Glimmer in the Fog"
GWF.10.desc: "Stuttgart breathed the dust of reconstruction. Broken shop windows were patched with plywood in places, while vegetables were sold from carts stolen from collapsed collective farms on the squares. Vagrants still roamed the streets, but now they rummaged through trash not out of hunger, but in search of building materials. Homura walked past without raising her eyes. Her black dress seemed too gloomy for this half-alive city where even the rain washed soot from facades.\n\n— Akemi-sama! — A teenager in a patched-up jacket called out to her. He held a stack of newspapers with the headline 'Administration Announces School Enrollment.' — Thank you... mom says without you...\n\nHomura slowed her pace but didn't respond. Thank you? For what? She merely signed the papers they slipped to her. Was that enough?\n\nThe town hall, once a grim Gothic fortress, was now covered in scaffolding. 'Security Forces' stood guard at the entrance—not thugs in black but ordinary policemen in worn uniforms. Their chief, Hans Filbinger, waited for her by the doors holding a folder of reports.\n\n— Ojou-sama, — he bowed like a nobleman from the last century, — Sector Z, damaged during the war with the Russians, has been restored. But the situation with raiders from Frankfurt isn't improving.\n\n— Build fortifications—ditches, bunkers. Something to stop them, or at least slow them down, — the magical girl replied.\n\n— Forgive me, but we don't have resources to... — Hans tried to counter.\n\n— Did you think I could perform miracles? — Homura looked at him directly for the first time. — Do what you can.\n\nHe froze, then nodded and left her alone with the map. The large canvas labeled 'Greater German Reich of the German Nation' was covered with scribbled notes, hastily drawn borders, and flags. The Baltic coast of Germany was particularly highlighted—rumors of an 'Island God' were spreading there.\n\nThat evening she went to the rooftop. The city no longer burned—instead, kerosene lamps flickered in windows. An accordion played somewhere, mixing with merchants' shouts. Even in this chaos, life found its way through the cracks.\n\n— You don't seem like a tyrant, — a voice came from behind. Hans stood in the doorway holding a coffee cup. — People believe you'll save them.\n\n— They're mistaken, — Homura turned away.\n\n— Perhaps. But as long as they believe, they find strength to fix sewers and raise children. — He placed the cup on the parapet. — Sometimes it's enough just... to be.\n\nHe left, and Homura kept staring into the dark distance of clouds."

Below, the square teemed with hundreds: workers in grease-stained overalls, mothers holding children, elders leaning on canes. The Security Forces held back the crowd, but even their stern faces couldn't hide the tense anticipation. The clerks who prepared the speech and organized the event also buzzed with nervous energy.\n\n— Citizens of Stuttgart, — Homura's voice sounded mechanical, like a robot reciting memorized lines, — our city has endured... hardships. But together we... will rebuild... — She fell silent, staring at the crowd. The paper trembled in her fingers. A flash of pink in the crowd triggered a memory. 'This isn't what they need,' came a sudden thought.\n\nHer heart skipped. Homura released the paper, letting it flutter down on the wind.\n\n— Do you know what it's like to lose everything? — Her voice cracked into a shout, unexpectedly sharp and alive. The crowd stilled. — You cling to ruins like a last thread. So do I. But if we fight only for stones, we'll forget who we're lifting them for.\n\nShe paused, as if surprised by her own words. Someone shouted: 'For family!' Another: 'For children!'\n\n— Yes. For those we love, — Homura gripped the railing, feeling her Soul Gem pulse warmly in her pocket. — Even if they're gone. Even if... you think they can't return.\n\nThe crowd erupted in applause. Some cried, others embraced neighbors. Hans, usually reserved, smiled into his fist. And Homura, descending into the hall, caught herself wondering: 'Where did those words come from?'"

GWF.12.t: "Shadow of Silence"
GWF.12.desc: "Stuttgart breathed ashes. Broken shop windows gaped like empty eye sockets, while packs of vagrants roamed the streets, trading curses and bottles of cheap wine. Distant gunfire echoed—whether gangs dividing territory or police maintaining a facade of order. Homura walked through the center, ignoring the shouts. Her black dress merged with ruin-shadows, her cold sharp gaze scanning the horizon as if searching for a glimpse of pink hair.\n\n— Akemi-sama! — A raspy voice stopped her. From under a collapsed awning crawled an old man in a tattered coat. — You... you're our ruler? Help! They took our last food...\n\nHomura slowed but didn't stop.\n\n— Find those who still believe in decrees. I'm busy, — she tossed over her shoulder. The old man froze, as if expecting nothing else, then hobbled away muttering about 'cursed magicians.'\n\nShe turned into an alley where chestnut trees once bloomed. Now it was littered with furniture fragments and rusted barrels. Nearby, outside a bar, a veteran argued with a homeless man before the sound of a head being bashed echoed. Kyubey's mocking voice surfaced: 'You could've turned this city into a fortress. But you chose to observe.' Observe... Yes. Only what lay beyond this hell interested her. Madoka. Just Madoka.\n\nThe town hall stood stark against the city's death throes. The building remained nearly untouched, an island of calm—unsurprising, given the square before it and surrounding blocks were packed with soldiers from the 'Leibstandarte Homura Akemi.' Entering, she was greeted with a salute by their commander, Wilhelm Mohnke.\n\n— Mein Fü... Ojou-sama, the city's situation is spiraling. We must act, — the officer began.\n\n— Do as you see fit. Just don't all die out there, — the magical girl waved him off.\n\nNodding, Wilhelm left to announce police operations. Homura ascended to the rooftop where she once admired the city. Now the view showed smoking chimneys and barricades. Soldiers receiving orders fanned through streets, killing indiscriminately. Controlled chaos had its merits, but sometimes required taming."

'I must be firmer, yes, firmer. Like always, right?' the magical girl thought with a nervous chuckle.\n\n— Citizens... — her voice wavered. In the crowd flashed an unusual yet painfully familiar blue-haired silhouette. This shouldn't be happening. Words tangled, her mind overloaded, eyes frantically scanning the text. — Stuttgart... is your home. We must... 'tasukete'... forgive me, we... 'bitte, vertrauen Sie mir'...\n\nSilence. Faces below twisted in confusion. Someone laughed. Someone hurled a rotten tomato toward the balcony. A discontented murmur spread through the crowd.\n\n— 'Watashi wa...' — she gasped, limbs turning to ice, mouth petrified. — I... can't...\n\nThe crowd roared. Though mostly indistinct, occasional shouts of 'madwoman', 'this is our leader?', 'disgrace' struck her ears like blows. Security Forces rushed to disperse people, but chaos already engulfed the square. Homura retreated into shadows, hands pressed to her ears. 'How awful' was the only thought in her mind. Shame made her wish the ground would swallow her whole.\n\nNext morning, the city pretended nothing happened. Markets opened, children played in streets, and clerks submitting reports either didn't remember or convincingly feigned ignorance of yesterday's events. Snatching a fresh newspaper, she found the 'disgraceful speech' buried at the bottom of the front page. Crumpling the paper, Homura threw it into the furnace."

This time she wasn't alone; an utterly loathsome creature, Kyubey, prowled nearby. Like an ordinary cat, it paced the tower's metal beams, waiting.\n\n— I asked you to investigate beyond the city. Report all available information, — Homura cut through the wind's noise.\n\n— Indeed you did. Our data indicates an organization of fellow 'transplanted individuals' northwest, led by SuzuhA Amane. You may find common ground. To the east lies Bavarian Gomorrah Republic, governed by Ernst Röhm, bodybuilder-actors, and effeminate historical figure variants...\n\n— Enough. Just tell me who poses threats or could aid us, — Homura interrupted the vivid description.\n\n— If so, the primary threat is Wilayat Almania under Albert Speer. He's uniting neighboring states against '2D abominations'—meaning you, Amane's faction, and anyone he dislikes.\n\n— So war is inevitable?\n\n— Yes. I'd recommend forging alliances with potentially friendly states. The choice is yours, Homura Akemi.\n\n— Understood..., — the magical girl replied softly.\n\nHomura stood and leaped from the tower. As a magical girl, the fall meant nothing. Wind rushing past her face cleared her thoughts, forming plans. 'Should buy some maps,' Akemi thought ironically."

Yet diplomacy demanded readiness for anything. Even the most odious might prove useful in the coming war.\n\nThe city looked bizarre—not its architecture, which remained intact—but from countless posters, flags, and banners transforming streets into a garish carnival. Approaching Hofburg, the visual cacophony blended with demonstration chants, further grating on the magical girl's nerves.\n\nAt the palace doors stood three guards dressed in God-knows-what. Recognizing their guest, they opened up. 'Welcome!' said the first. 'Long live the revolution!' the second. 'Sieg Heil!' the third. To Homura, this signaled everything would be thoroughly absurd.\n\nReaching the designated 'negotiation hall', Homura sighed. First impressions already horrified her. Who actually governed this mess? Steeling herself, she entered. Inside, five figures: one smoking a pipe, another by a canvas, a third napping silently.\n\n— Greetings, we've awaited you, — began the man with brush-like mustache.\n\n— Aloizych, fine hospitality, but let each speak for themselves, — countered the pipe-smoker.\n\n— Josif, damn you! I'm freelance artist Shicklgruber, not some 'Aloizych'!\n\n— Both shut up, we're negotiating! — interjected the bearded man.\n\nThe bearded one studied her intensely before blurting: 'Pronounced homosexual tendencies...' The man with sideburns in imperial uniform quietly cautioned: 'Sigmund, temper your conclusions.'\n\n— I came to propose an alliance, — Homura, flushed, cut through the chaos. — So spare me irrelevant talk. At this, they fell silent, nodded, and huddled. After brief exchange, all five declared: 'We agree!'"

GWF.16.desc: "Homura stood in the empty town hall room, completely vacant. The only remaining item was a small chandelier with a single screwed-in light bulb. This entire interior setup was a requirement for the meeting with the Baden resistance leader. They had refused to visit her, proposing to come independently instead. Their list of demands seemed slightly... paranoid. But Homura accepted all conditions, as the "resistance" was one of the strongest factions in the region.\n\nThe door swung open, revealing three individuals in camouflage uniforms. A tall bearded man entered first, briefly circled the room, then exited to confer with two others outside the door. From the fragmented whispers, only the name "Günther" could be discerned. The German remained outside, while the other two entered simultaneously. They were not much taller than Homura—the first was a girl with braided hair, the second likely also a girl with short black hair.\n\n- Thank you for coming here. I imagine this was no simple task for you? — Homura initiated the conversation.\n\n- Yes. We feared CERN might have placed tails on you, so we decided to travel independently, — the auburn-haired girl spoke. — I am Amane Suzuhа, and this is Urushibara Ruka, my partner.\n\n- A pleasure to meet you. I am Akemi Homura. Truthfully, I did not expect to encounter... individuals of your kind here. Especially with women in leadership roles.\n\nSudden silence engulfed the room. Suzuhа merely raised an eyebrow slightly, as if anticipating something.\n\n- Excuse me, but I'm actually a guy, — Ruka quietly broke the silence.\n\nSeveral seconds passed as the mage processed this information. Realizing her blunder, Homura abruptly performed a formal Japanese bow. «I deeply apologize for my tactlessness, Ruka. This is an inexcusable error,» — she repeated in a trembling voice, flushed with embarrassment.\n\n- I-It's fine. This isn't the first time this has happened to me, — Ruka responded.\n\n- Akemi, we all make mistakes. There's no need to apologize so fervently, — Suzuhа smiled, calming the flustered girl across from her.\n\n- Y-yes, forgive me. Nevertheless, we are not here for idle chatter, — Homura said, straightening up."

He simply couldn't comprehend how any of this had transpired.\n\n- By Allah's grace, stop shaking like that already, — a gruff Arabic voice sounded from the wall.\n\n- Suheil, be silent! You shouldn't even be here! — Bashar retorted.\n\n- Neither of us should be here, yet here we are, — the general sighed.\n\n- This is all your fault! Why didn't your "Tigers" protect Aleppo, Hama, Damascus?\n\n- You expect too much from me when I lacked funding for my units. But right now, if not for me, al-Reini would have already hanged you.\n\n- Oh Allah! Why is this happening to me! According to intel, our negotiation counterpart resembles an ordinary schoolgirl. Why such honor?\n\n- Schoolgirl or not, she currently controls a vast territory south of us. Any assistance would be beneficial.\n\nBashar sighed wordlessly, recognizing the futility of arguing now. Negotiations were to begin in an hour, yet he already felt on the verge of collapse. However, he needed to maintain composure to avoid repeating past mistakes. The clock relentlessly counted down to the meeting.\n\nThe door burst open. Before Bashar and Suheil appeared a young girl in an unusual gray suit. Despite her short stature and youthful appearance, her expression radiated an intense coldness that permeated the room. It instantly became clear this was no time for jokes or levity.\n\n- Greetings. Akemi Homura, Bashar al-Assad — President of the Luxembourg Republic, — the first bowed while rising from his chair.\n\n- Akemi Homura. Sole... ruler of Stuttgart and surrounding territories, — the entering girl responded with a slight pause, her voice icy."

Eventually, Speer declared himself "Emir of Almania 'Muhammad al-Reini'" and announced full transition to Sharia law.\n\nHeinz didn't particularly care about politics, dismissing it as unserious. But daily life grew increasingly absurd. Eventually, he joined a resistance organization. Being deeply pacifist, Heinz never used weapons, limiting himself to leafleting and wall graffiti.\n\nEverything shattered when news arrived at work that his younger sister Amelia had been killed for "disrespecting a morality police officer"—a vague charge that could mean anything. Heinz never believed this madness would touch him. Yet it did.\n\nThus began his path of guerrilla warfare. Explosions, arson, sabotage, assaults—all became familiar concepts. The resistance road proved arduous, marked by failures and successes.\n\nSuddenly, news arrived of a Luxembourg-Frankfurt agreement to transport al-Reini regime opponents to Bashar al-Assad. Without hesitation, nearly all members of Heinz's group accepted the deal.\n\nOn the day of "transportation," Heinz and comrades gathered at an empty bus station containing only two red buses.

Morning checkpoints ensured no enemy agents or saboteurs could infiltrate the conference.\n\nBy noon, the first delegations arrived—some in regular car convoys, others in armored carriers, and surprisingly, some on foot. Guards at the entrance received guests with utmost protocol. This was Württemberg's first major diplomatic initiative; no missteps could be tolerated. No casualties, complete satisfaction.\n\nHomura sat in her office as usual, awaiting updates on delegation arrivals. She repeatedly reviewed her welcome speech, its paper riddled with smudges, cross-outs, and last-minute additions—risks needed minimization. «I'll remove this here,» the mage struck through another word.\n\n- Akemi, all delegations are assembled. It's time, — announced a guard entering the office.\n\n- Good. Gather everyone in the hall—I'll meet them there, — Homura replied, rising.\n\nTen minutes later, delegations and Homura stood in the hall. Facing them, she began her address. Though visibly nervous with occasional stumbles, she delivered the prepared speech without major issues. Afterwards, she directed delegates to the negotiation chamber resembling a military war room.\n\nAfter lengthy discussions, consensus on the impending war emerged by evening. A ceremonial dinner followed, its atmosphere relaxed for both delegates and Homura. By midnight, most delegations had departed Stuttgart—only the «Anti-CERN» resistance group remained, planning to leave at dawn. Ultimately, the meeting concluded successfully."
GWF.19.a: "A crucial step"

GWF.20.t: "Introduction"
GWF.20.desc: "Among the witches of the Württemberg Army, the mysterious 'Cleansing' units stood apart. Their purpose was unknown to ordinary soldiers. The aura of secrecy and uncertainty attracted young girls, though no one truly knew what they actually did. Many rumors circulated about them, varying in absurdity. But the most widespread theory was counterintelligence—hunting traitors and spies.\n\nOne of those fascinated by the 'Cleansing' was Sergeant Agnia. She had become a witch and joined the army very recently, just a couple of months prior. In that short time, she demonstrated impressive results, leading to a rapid promotion. Stories of fearless agents risking their lives to root out enemies in the rear were thrilling. Such was the legend of the witches in black uniforms.\n\nGunhild, a member of one such unit, loved strolling through the forest near the barracks. Solitude and nature soothed her. Closing her eyes and holding her boots in hand, she walked slowly across the grass. But her walk didn’t last long—she tripped over something hard and fell to the ground. A soft cry rang out. 'I’m sorry!' came a voice from the right.\n\nOpening her eyes and rolling onto her back, she saw a girl a few years younger, trembling as she stared down at her, looking as if she might burst into tears on the spot. 'It’s fine... I wasn’t paying attention either,' Gunhild replied quietly, still lying on the ground. 'Y-you’re from the Cleansing, and I, I—' the russet-haired girl stammered nervously. As Gunhild watched her, a strange thought flickered through the officer’s mind, causing a faint blush to spread across her face.\n\nShaking off the leaves and her confusing thoughts, the witch in black began to rise. The other witch grabbed her arm to help. 'Sorry again,' she said, 'I’m Sergeant Agniya, 3rd Battalion.' Gunhild put her boots back on, nodded, and slowly walked toward the forest’s edge. A voice called out behind her: 'Excuse me, what’s your name?' 'Gunhild,' came the soft reply."
GWF.20.a: "Did she hear it?"

GWF.21.t: "This Doesn’t Even Look Like an Army!"
GWF.21.desc: "Homura walked through a small military town on the outskirts of Stuttgart, flanked by a pair of officers. The officers explained the current state of Württemberg’s armed forces. Yet even without their words or complex reports, the direness of the situation was plain.\n\nWhat they called a 'divisional headquarters' resembled, at best, a club for people who liked dressing up in military uniforms. Many barracks and warehouses stood empty or even looted. The parade ground was covered in either leaves or some kind of trash. The soldiers who remained wandered aimlessly; some were drunk or worse.\n\nThe scant remaining equipment looked no better than rusty scrap metal. At best, they might manage to start a couple of Opels and one armored personnel carrier. Everything appeared so pitiful and helpless that it seemed a mere thousand well-trained, motivated troops could wipe out this entire rabble.\n\n- Oberst, what do you propose we do? - Homura asked the officer with colonel’s insignia.\n\n- Uh... as you can see, Ojou-sama, we practically have no army, - he replied.\n\n- So we must start from scratch? - the girl asked.\n\n- It seems so. I’ve done all I could to prevent things from worsening further. My apologies, - the colonel said, pressing his cap to his chest.\n\nHomura paused, lost in thought about how to rebuild the army. An idea struck her: forming an army of witches. Their physical resilience and abilities were worth more than hundreds of soldiers. However, this clashed with the difficulty of recruiting even a thousand such troops. Building a classical army would be easier, but it would mean sacrificing quality for quantity in the short term. Sighing, Homura continued her inspection of the base."
GWF.21.a: "Need to think"

GWF.22.t: "A New Type of Army"
GWF.22.desc: "Homura stood in the town hall, awaiting the arrival of the first witch-soldiers. She had enlisted Kyubey for this task, but the feasibility of forming such forces seemed dubious. How could dozens or hundreds of magical girls, each with their own desires and goals, be forged into a unified force? Time dragged on, and with each passing minute, the urge to abandon this endeavor grew.\n\nFinally, fifteen girls around her age entered the hall. These were the first recruits. Now came the hard part: figuring out how to mold them into an army. Sighing, Homura began addressing the witches.\n\n- Welcome. State your name, your wish, and why you’re here, - Homura spoke.\n\nOne by one, the witches introduced themselves. Their wishes varied wildly, yet oddly, their stated reasons for joining aligned perfectly with what Homura wanted to hear. Variations of 'to protect the Fatherland' were exactly the answers needed to join the new army. After a brief selection process, fourteen of the fifteen were accepted.\n\nIn the end, over a couple of weeks, several hundred witches were gathered. Homura herself was surprised by the speed of recruitment, though she’d initially considered her idea doomed. Of course, numerous challenges remained: how to sustain recruitment, how to combat 'despair' among new soldiers. But that was a matter for later. Thus began the magical forces of Württemberg."
GWF.22.a: "An unusual army for an unusual country"

GWF.23.t: "New Life"
GWF.23.desc: "Emma never seemed to complain about her life. Born to an army officer and a schoolteacher. Yes, her family was incomplete—her mother died during childbirth. But her father was a man of great warmth who did his best to raise her with tenderness. Like all soldiers, he went to war against the Russians a few years ago and perished. Thus, Emma came under the care of her grandfather, a retired officer.\n\nHe was the polar opposite of her father—harsh and crude. A hardened militarist, he never missed a chance to sneer. Her grandfather resented that she’d never become a proper soldier simply because she was born a girl. Truthfully, Emma was fascinated by military affairs, but her father had shielded her from it, wanting to break the tradition. Her grandfather, meanwhile, grumbled remarks like 'you can’t make a soldier out of a woman' yet occasionally shared tidbits.\n\nNow, while out shopping, Emma couldn’t stop dreaming of a soldier’s life. Her eyes caught a colorful poster plastered at the store entrance. It depicted a girl her age in an unusual uniform. 'A wish in exchange for defending the Fatherland,' read the slogan, alongside the town hall’s address. 'This is my chance,' she thought. Abandoning her errands, she headed there.\n\nThere, she met a girl named Homura Akemi. Homura explained the details of magical military service—the wishes, Kyubey, and the power he granted. Returning home in a magical girl uniform, Emma told her grandfather everything. With a faint smile, he uttered just one phrase."
GWF.23.a: "Honor the tradition with dignity"

GWF.24.t: "Duel"
GWF.24.desc: "Near Ulm lay an old airbase, repurposed by Homura’s orders into a magical forces headquarters. Drawing on knowledge of magical girls’ lifestyles and Kyubey’s hints, the base was designed to maximize combat readiness. It also fostered camaraderie and rivalry, transforming random girls into cohesive units.\n\nIn one barracks corridor, two girls collided and fell. Whether accidental or intentional was unclear—they’d long been rivals, always seeking conflict. As they stood, the bickering began.\n\n- Hey, Martha, there’s enough space for two here! - snapped a red-haired witch.\n\n- Oh? Did someone whistle in my ear? - mocked a blonde witch, glancing around. - Ah, it’s our dear Ursula!\n\n- Shut up, or I’ll slug you right here! How much longer will you provoke me?\n\n- Enough. Let’s settle this in a duel.\n\nThe witches marched to a specially prepared arena—fences, artificial ruins, and barricades simulating real combat. Shaking hands, they vowed to fight to the death to reclaim honor and avoid disgrace.\n\nThus clashed an archer and an arquebusier. Deafening shots pierced walls, leaving gaping holes, while arrows curved around obstacles to strike true. The duel lasted nearly an hour, neither yielding. Ursula, the archer, finally began to falter. In the final moments, the red-haired witch lay battered against a wall.\n\n- Surrender? - asked her opponent, leaping closer. - You’re clearly spent.\n\n- Such shame... - Gasping, Ursula gripped her Soul Gem. - I won’t surren...\n\nA gunshot cut her off. The bullet shattered her palm, spraying colored glass shards. From the shadows emerged a black-haired girl in a tunic parodying Prussian uniforms, a lizard-emblazoned beret on her head. She calmly patted the victor.\n\n- Congratulations. Your endurance and strength are exceptional. Soldiers like you will be our army’s backbone. Tomorrow, you’ll be promoted. - With that, the figure vanished as silently as she’d appeared."
GWF.24.a: "Wait—that was the commander-in-chief!"

GWF.25.t: "Recruits to Generals"
GWF.25.desc: "Homura sat in a dimly lit room in the town hall. The sparse interior held only a table, a small board, and two chairs. What was she doing here? The answer was simple: to build an army, you need commanders.\n\nShe’d sent enlistment letters to officers of varying ranks across Württemberg. Sadly, only three responded—but three was better than none. Today, the highest-ranking volunteer would arrive: Wehrmacht Oberstleutnant Otto Tetsuroshtamm.\n\nThe door opened. A tall, gaunt elderly man in civilian clothes entered, exuding military bearing despite the lack of uniform. Behind him followed a younger man with long white hair. Homura didn’t question the unexpected guest.\n\n- Greetings. I am Otto Tetsuroshtamm. Forgive my bluntness, but my adjutant, Feldwebel Arthur Juz, will accompany me. I hear you’re assembling an army?\n\n- Correct. I need competent commanders. What are your credentials, Herr Tetsuroshtamm?\n\n- I anticipated this. - Otto smirked, slapping a thick folder on the table. - My successes and failures as a commander. Arthur’s records are here too.\n\n- Impressive. - Homura skimmed the documents. - You’ll both serve well.\n\nShe rose and extended her hand. The officers stood, shaking it in turn. At last, the army had its first leaders."
GWF.25.a: "An army without a head is no army."

GWF.26.t: "Speech to the Recruits"
GWF.26.desc: "Today, several thousand people stood on the square in front of the town hall. One might have thought it was another procession, rally, or strike. But the precise and orderly formation of all present showed that these were far from ordinary people. This was a massive formation of soldiers who had just enlisted in the local army. They all awaited the address by the ruler of Stuttgart.\n\nSoon, a short, black-haired girl ascended a specially constructed high tribune. Clearing her throat slightly, she began her speech:\n\n'Dear comrades, citizens, residents of Württemberg. I thank you for your patience and for your decision to pledge allegiance to the Fatherland. It is an honor for me to stand on this tribune before you, brave sons and daughters of Germany. You stand here not because you were forced or coerced, but by the call of your souls.\n\nIt matters not what you look like, what political views you hold, or anything else. Bormannites, Speerites, communists, democrats — none of this holds any meaning now. Above all, you are Germans. And this is something to take pride in. Though Germany faces hardships today, I believe — I know — that we will overcome them and restore historical justice.\n\nThank you all for being here. Germany above all!'\n\nAfter these words, Homura slowly descended from the tribune, and the crowd of soldiers on the square erupted into cheers. 'That was... exhausting,' she whispered with a sigh, turning her head toward the crowd. Yet alongside the weight of the speech, there was a sense of pride in what had been achieved in such a short time."
GWF.26.a: "Perhaps something will come of this"

GWF.27.t: "War Games"
GWF.27.desc: "A vast field dozens of kilometers from Stuttgart was dotted with hastily erected barracks and military equipment. Army drills simulating real combat conditions were underway here. Today was the penultimate and most critical day — a mock battle against a hypothetical enemy. The objective was to capture a hill near the field as quickly as possible. Three brigades totaling fifteen thousand soldiers were assigned to the assault. Far more had participated in earlier stages of the exercises, but now it was the turn of the final brigades.\n\nOn a neighboring small hill, an observation post had been set up. Officers sat at tables on either side, while in a separate room, two individuals watched the soldiers emerging from the barracks. One observed with genuine interest, jotting notes in a small notebook; the other seemed more focused on the landscape surrounding the troops.\n\n'To build an army in such a short time — impressive work,' remarked the general.\n\n'Otto, the praise should go more to you and the General Staff,' replied the girl, tossing her hair.\n\n'Well, Akemi, it was you who found competent generals,' Otto countered.\n\n'Let's consider this a shared success. I’d rather not debate degrees of contribution — the main action is about to begin,' Homura pointed out.\n\nBy evening, full reports on the mock battle had arrived. General Tetsurostamm was thoroughly pleased with the results. Homura understood little of the military terminology, but if it worked — it worked."
GWF.27.a: "The Call of Duty"

GWF.28.t: "The Big Haul"
GWF.28.desc: "Homura was currently in Thuringia, carefully navigating through forests and villages as she approached her target. This area supposedly housed a massive military base with an equally enormous warehouse of military equipment. Naturally, as a key military hub in northern Germany, it was heavily guarded, with patrols numbering at least several hundred soldiers.\n\nPreparation time for the operation had been limited, necessitating improvisation. As the sorceress drew closer to the base, the structures grew increasingly imposing. Homura felt absolutely certain that there would be enough weapons here to arm a vast number of people.\n\nTime froze. In this suspended moment, the girl approached a tall chain-link fence. After a short run-up, she vaulted over the barrier and began moving slowly past hangars. Locating the correct warehouses proved extraordinarily difficult. The previously studied schematics no longer matched the layout, rendering them useless. She had to find ways to break into the storage facilities.\n\nExternally, they resembled iron barrels with a single entrance, now blocked by guards. Without hesitation, Homura devised a plan to distract the base personnel. Carrying this idea, she headed toward the barracks. After retreating a dozen meters from the residential zone, the sorceress retrieved a couple of mortar shells and a dozen smoke grenades, assembling a small but highly conspicuous bomb. Activating it, she returned to the warehouses.\n\nTime resumed. A distant explosion roared, followed by thick smoke billowing upward. The soldiers guarding the hangars turned and rushed toward the source, leaving the warehouses unprotected. Freezing time again, Homura pulled out a shotgun and blasted the locks off the doors. To her delight, the adjacent warehouses contained all manner of useful equipment — artillery, rifles, and machine guns. After stashing nearly an entire arsenal within her spatial shield, the sorceress departed the base."
GWF.28.a: "A Morning Surprise Awaits Them"

GWF.29.desc: "A large field dozens of kilometers from Stuttgart hosted hastily erected barracks. Army drills simulating real combat conditions were underway. Today marked the penultimate and most critical day — a mock battle against a hypothetical enemy. The objective was to capture a hill near the field as swiftly as possible. By morning, thousands of soldiers had assembled in prearranged formations. A careless observer might assume these were routine brigade exercises, but this was the entire Württemberg army.\n\nIn truth, these drills were unique. They marked the world’s first combat deployment of magical troops assembled under Homura’s command. Even gathering this number had been an immense challenge. Young women, now organized into regiments and battalions, donned sorceress uniforms as they prepared for the exercise.\n\nThe first two regiments wore colorful costumes and dresses, with only armbands and epaulettes denoting military affiliation. The rest appeared nearly identical — a result of Homura’s “new recruitment model.” While the “colorful” units lacked a unifying motive, the others shared variations of a theme: defending the Fatherland.\n\nA nearby hill housed an observation post. Surprisingly sparse for its size, it contained only one occupant — a girl in a violet uniform staring blankly through the window. In fifteen minutes, the drill would commence. Exactly on schedule, some took to the skies, others advanced on foot, hammering at mock fortifications. ‘Could this horde defeat Walpurgisnacht?’ Homura smirked to herself.\n\nBy evening, officers reported overwhelmingly satisfactory results. With a nod, she authorized further actions."

GWF.30.desc: "Homura navigated Thuringia’s forests and villages, approaching her target — a massive northern German military base housing an equally vast weapons depot. As a strategic hub, it boasted hundreds of patrols.\n\nTime froze. She vaulted over a chain-link fence and crept past hangars. Locating the correct warehouses proved arduous — outdated schematics forced improvisation. The structures resembled iron barrels with single entrances, all guarded.\n\nInspecting her Soul Gem’s darkening spots, Homura realized prolonged time-stop was untenable. ‘No choice but brute force.’ Drawing a submachine gun, she executed the guards with headshots before blasting door locks.\n\nTime resumed. Guards collapsed; doors flew open. Unfortunately, bullet impacts on metal triggered alarms. Sirens wailed as troops converged. Before reactivating her shield, something heavy pinned her down. ‘Got you, intruder,’ growled a voice.\n\n‘Perfect,’ Homura seethed. Her free hand groped for the shield, retrieving a flashbang. She hurled it upward. The deafening blast staggered the soldier. ‘Fucking bitch!’ he roared, clutching his head. Homura bucked him off and fled.\n\nThe dazed soldier lunged again, fingertips grazing her heel. She vanished mid-stride."

GWF.31.t: "Red Day"  
GWF.31.desc: "Homura sat tensely in her sandbag-fortified office, military maps and reports littering her desk. Coalition forces would soon launch a preemptive strike against Speer’s faction. War hinged on one signal.\n\nHer eyes locked onto the crimson emergency hotline linking all allies. The call came abruptly. She snatched the receiver.\n\n‘Lovely dawn today, isn’t it?’ a woman’s voice chimed.\n\n‘Agreed. Let’s gather ten lycoris bouquets. The dawns are so quiet,’ Homura replied cryptically.\n\n‘Two bouquets from us. Vienna and Luxembourg send three.’\n\n‘We’ll take two. Goodbye.’\n\nTo outsiders, this sounded like gibberish. Homura already dialed headquarters: ‘Full readiness. Commence in twenty.’ Rising slowly, she exited. ‘It begins,’ she thought."

GWF.32.desc: "Homura was in one of the numerous border bunkers built before the war. Reinforced concrete walls, a specialized ventilation system, stocks of provisions, and ammunition - each fortification had enough to function as a standalone fortress. Yet, even here, there was no sense of safety. Exploding shells and flying bullets were a constant reminder that a war was raging. The magical girl stood on the top floor of the stronghold, where narrow slits called windows offered a view of the battlefield.\n\nTrenches and dugouts, craters from artillery shells, burned-out vehicles, and heaps of corpses - such was the scene of this war. Sighing, Homura silently gazed at the sight. 'The last way to settle scores,' she voiced her thought aloud.\n\n'Amazing how, with the development of means to destroy your own kind, you haven’t gone extinct yet,' a voice sounded from somewhere to the side.\n\n'Incubator, shut up. I don’t want to hear you right now,' the magical girl snapped sharply.\n\n'I’m just saying there’s no need to resort to every possible measure. If the war is won quickly, you could minimize losses.'\n\n'Still worried about collecting energy and entropy? To hell with you, now get lost.'\n\nThe creature appeared as suddenly as it vanished. And Homura continued to stare at the distant sounds of the bloody battle."

GWF.33.desc: "Gunhilda was wandering through the forest again. She used to enjoy the solitude, but lately, she always hoped to see one particular person there. For her, a perennial lone wolf, this was an entirely unfamiliar feeling. What was it? Could it really be… love? But how could it be - they were both girls. Her mind tried to signal that this was wrong, while her heart said something entirely different.\n\nFor Agnia, who sat at the spot where they first met, it was also something unusual. At first, Gunhilda seemed incredibly taciturn and even intimidating, and Agnia genuinely feared the consequences of that awkward encounter. But with each passing day, that first impression proved wildly inaccurate. The officer was extremely shy and reserved, yet they soon found a way to connect. And here she was again - they talked about everything imaginable in this world until evening.\n\nThe soldier’s routine went on as usual: wake-up, morning inspection. For Agnia, it had become second nature. But lately, she’d started feeling some sort of malaise - a mix of emotions, thoughts, and despair began to consume her soul. During the morning inspection, the commander examining the soul gems noticed an ominously dark hue in Agnia’s crystal. Frowning, she said nothing more and continued the check.\n\nA couple of hours later, Gunhilda entered the barracks, her face deathly pale. With a steady stride, she approached Agnia and, with a slight tremble, said, 'Sergeant, come with me.' Nodding, Agnia followed. 'What? Why me?' raced through her mind. Suddenly, Gunhilda led her into the forest - the very one where they’d met. Standing at that spot again and taking a deep breath, the magical girl in the black uniform began to speak.\n\n'You don’t know what our purpose is, do you?'\n\n'No, what do you mean?'\n\nBiting her lip, the cleanup agent began to explain everything: about witches and soul gems, the true purpose of the squads, and what was about to happen. Agnia wanted to ask if this was a joke, but the unflinching expression on Gunhilda’s face made the gravity of the situation clear. Suddenly, Gunhilda pressed herself against Agnia, wrapping her arms around her. 'I… I should’ve told you sooner,' the officer cried through sobs. 'Heh, I thought the same, but I was afraid you’d reject me,' Agnia replied. 'I love… you,' they said to each other in unison. At that moment, both magical girls’ soul gems turned pitch black and shattered simultaneously, transforming the entire forest into a witch’s barrier."

'Boring, uninspired, but so familiar,' Richard, a typical resident of the city, mused to himself as he walked its streets on some errand.\n\nAround him were throngs of rushing, hurrying people, driven far by the unrest that had long been brewing among the populace due to the war that had erupted in Southern Germany. It worried many, but not Richard. Sometimes he asked himself, 'What do I care about politics and all these conflicts?' Then he’d shrug and return to his dreary, burdensome life in these troubled times.\n\nIt seemed fate had nothing interesting in store beyond the obvious struggle for survival. But fate had other plans entirely. In the distance, muffled explosions rang out, and crowds of townsfolk rushed past a bewildered Richard, who didn’t fully grasp what was happening.\n\nA roar from above tore through the sky. Planes began emerging from the clouds, descending lower to fulfill their bloody purpose. A grimace of fear twisted Richard’s face as he turned to flee from the horrors of war that had reached his home front.\n\nDozens of shells began raining down on Frankfurt’s streets, destroying the city and killing anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in the crossfire. One such shell exploded near Richard. But instead of the expected death, the young man experienced far worse torment. The blast wave didn’t kill him - it tore off his right arm, hurling its victim a few meters from the explosion site. To the general cacophony of horror were added cries of pain, involuntarily echoing around as if drowning out some of the blasts. And then it became clear: whether people cared about politics and disasters or not, everyone stood a chance of suffering from it all. Richard closed his eyes, unsure if he’d survive at all…"

One group of workers sluggishly shed their uniforms, finally heading off for some semblance of rest, while another group, no less exhausted, donned their work clothes to start another grueling day on the job.\n\nUlrich Feld, one of the factory workers, took up his duties, reflecting with a faint pang of melancholy on how things had turned out. Ulrich had first crossed the threshold of this building back in the distant 1950s, when life seemed far more promising and peaceful… Now, everything had become utterly wretched.\n\nShifts had been stretched to unbearable lengths, and production quotas - so vast they could stun even the most industrially advanced nations - weighed like a dead burden on everyone unfortunate enough to be tied to this work. Though, who had it easy these days?\n\nRunning through his life’s journey in his mind, Ulrich stepped up to his machine and began his tasks. He still needed something to live on. But a heavy feeling lingered in his heart. Even during the recent Second West Russian War, despite all the circumstances, life had been much easier. That much was certain.\n\nA sudden thought struck Ulrich. He realized that this way of life had taken a toll on his health. He felt far weaker, his body ceaselessly begging for rest. Yet, despite recognizing his struggles, Feld kept laboring tirelessly. The Fatherland demanded loyalty and total dedication from its citizens in this critical fight for survival. And Ulrich wouldn’t back down, even if it killed him.\n\nStill, doubts crept into the worker’s mind… Why was he doing this? What if, after all this, the contributions of people like him were simply forgotten? What was he working for? To work even more, only to keep working after that? But what was the ultimate goal?"

Muffled explosions echoed from the city’s outskirts; someone had struck the city again.\n\nFolding her hands over her stomach, Homura began pacing circles around the office, searching for a way to turn the tide. She noticed that the ticking of the clock on the wall had stopped. 'Broken,' she whispered, and at that moment, an idea struck her. She had the power to stop time. Of course, it would take immense effort to win the war with that ability alone.\n\nAnother explosion roared, this time near the town hall, sending plaster dust crumbling from the ceiling.

At first, he didn’t even notice the vehicle, continuing his walk to the store. But as it drew level with him and then stopped entirely, the van blocked the path of the now-confused young man.\n\nThe door swung open, and a stranger stepped out, dressed in military uniform.

Spinning around, he bolted, trying to escape. But soldiers poured out of the van, chasing after him and quickly catching up. After landing a few blows, they dragged Klaus back and shoved him into the van, carting off yet another person to the front.

Around him lay the bodies of his comrades, supposed enemies, and the innocent alike. The horrifying scene threw the soldier off balance, causing him to stumble into the mud time and again, only to rise and continue his arduous flight.\n\nAt times, Siegfried wondered: how could people turn against one another like this? Just a few years ago, a united nation had looked forward with pride, supporting each other… Now, everyone was ready to stab their closest friend in the back for some incomprehensible ideals.

Среди тех, кто был вынужден бежать, затесался Зигфрид, давно потерявший надежду в этот мир. Ему уже было все равно на обстановку, он просто желал убежать и спрятаться, пока всё не утихомирится. Вокруг валялись трупы его товарищей, предполагаемых недругов и просто невинных. От ужасающей картины солдат терял равновесие, из раза в раз падая в грязь, но поднимаясь, чтобы продолжить свой нелегкий побег.\n\nПорой Зигфрид думал: как можно идти друг против друга? Ещё пару лет назад единая нация гордо смотрела вперёд, поддерживая друг друга... А сегодня каждый готов воткнуть нож в спину своего самого близкого человека ради каких-то непонятных идеалов. Что стало с немецким народом? Он стал жесток... Он прислуживает непонятным управленцам, которые плевать хотели на кого-либо, кроме себя. Это был настоящий кошмар. Наконец достигнув более-менее спокойного места.\n\nЗигфрид перевёл дыхание, пока перед ним не произошла картина, ужаснувшая его до глубины души.\n\nГде-то вдалеке раздался чудовищный взрыв, ознаменовавший начало настоящего апокалипсиса. Атомная бомба, чья мощность пугала каждого, разорвалась в небесах, уничтожая всё вокруг, сжигая и разрушая всё, что встанет перед взрывной волной, оставляя после себя облака радиации.\n\nУвидев поднимавшийся ядерный гриб, Зигфрид практически сразу смирился со своей судьбой, дожидаясь этого проклятого финала. Всего через пару секунд, волна атомного взрыва дошла до молодого человека, принеся ему несколько мгновений самых мучительных страданий. Тело разрывается, а после и вовсе сгорает от такого немыслимого количества энергии. Зигфрид даже не успел вскрикнуть, но боль была самой сильной для него... В конце концов, смерть для него наступила очень быстро, хоть и очень неприятно."

Солдаты в серых формах сопровождали автоколонну. Как всегда, они были мрачнее ночи. Башар сидел во втором автомобиле, нервно глядя на Сухейля. "Что-то мне не нравится всё это", - говорил тот ему, но собеседник особо его не слушал.\n\nПодъехав к ратуше, грозному готическому зданию, солдаты лейбштандарта открыли двери и медленно повели людей ко входу. Во входном зале их встретила черноволосая девушка в мундире и берете. На плече была фиолетовая повязка с изображённой на ней чёрной саламандрой. "Надеюсь, Лейбштандарт вам не доставил хлопот?", - с фальшивой улыбкой заговорила она. "Пройдёмте же в гостиный зал!", - позвала рукой глав государств.\n\nПройдя за волшебницей, они вошли в просторный зал со столами, заполненной едой. Конечно, нельзя было назвать этот ужин крайне роскошным, но для текущей ситуации даже такое было удивительным. "Извините за небольшую разруху, ещё не все восстановили", - слегка поклонившись, сказала Хомура. Союзники расселись по указанным местам, скоро приступя к трапезе.\n\nДля многих находившихся здесь, экзотические фрукты, великолепное филе и вино, заставшее еще времена Кампфцайта - всё это превратило ужин в лучшее, что они ели со времён попадания в этот мир.

Но для делегатов это не было чем-то стоящим внимания, ровно как и отсутствия правителей Бадена.\n\n"Что же, хочу дать небольшую речь, перед тем, как мы перейдем к десерту", - взяв бокал, заговорила монарх Вюртемберга. "Эта победа была достигнута большими усилиями, я рада, что Южная Германия теперь едина. Однако, настоящее празднование возможно только когда все препятствия будут убраны, так внутри, так и снаружи".

Нетрудно понять, что стоит решать судьбу хрупкой коалиции после окончания войны. Все видели итог по-разному. И именно за тем, чтобы определить, как не превратить победу в одной войне моментально в новую войну, сюда приехали дипломаты со всей Южной Германии.\n\nНа протяжении часа шли тяжелые споры между всеми союзниками, никто не мог прийти к какому-либо консенсусу. К Хомуре подбежал какой-то офицер и что-то ей сообщил. Лёгкая ухмылка появилась на лице волшебницы. В этот же момент она, сидящая "во главе" длинного стола, встала и ударила по столу. Давно готовящийся план начал действовать.\n\n- Господа и дамы, я хочу выдвинуть своё предложение, вы все сохраняете относительный контроль над своими территориями. Однако вы признаёте наше владычество над вами, - раздался угрожающий голос девушки.\n\nДелегаты начали возмущаться такой абсурдной идеей, с каждого угла стола слышалось негодование. Но тут же солдаты подняли свои винтовки и нацелили их на дипломатов.\n\n- Бесполезно, войска Вюртемберга уже заняли важные центры по всей Южной Германии, в один миг мы парализуем все ваши вотчины, а без вас - они станут лёгкой добычей.\n\nОшемлённые дерзостью такого плана лидеры стран-союзников просто молчали. Аккуратно некоторые делегации начали соглашаться с данным предложением, которые вылилось в единогласное одобрения.

Although ideas, sometimes defeated, sometimes triumphant, have a tendency to live on for a very long time as long as there are those who sincerely believe in them.\n\nThose who suffered defeat from the old factions now had to bow in the shadows, hiding from the hated regime that now ruled over them. Sometimes they wondered: how did it come to this? Why did their ideas, more righteous and supported by loyal followers, simply fail to hold their ground in this difficult struggle? A question without a clear answer... But that didn’t mean anyone would just give up.\n\nHaving regrouped, the opposition forces, once loyal to the fallen factions, made an attempt to start subversive activities against their new 'authority.'\n\nOn yet another restless evening, as if on schedule, people of different origins came one after another. And they were united by a single goal: to continue what they had started. Huddled under lamps in a small apartment, the gathered group began discussing future plans.\n\nThe usual course of fate was suddenly interrupted by a crash that echoed through the room with a ringing sound, making everyone present tense up. In an instant, unknown individuals appeared before them, armed with numerous weapons. Without giving anyone a chance to even speak, these strangers unleashed a hail of bullets on those who wished to resist the regime.\n\nThe goal was singular: eliminate the enemies.

Honestly, the prospect didn’t seem very promising.\n\nHe opened the window and looked out at Munich awakening. On the street, among the cars under a dirty brown sky, clerks, workers, and bandits scurried about. He wasn’t even surprised to spot a group of anthropomorphic green turtles, paying more attention to a young mail boy heading toward his house. He wasn’t expecting new correspondence from his partners, but deep down, he hoped for news from his relatives.\n\nTo his surprise, Otto discovered a letter with a strange stamp recently adopted by the Stuttgart 'government.'

Leaning his back against the cold wall, he slid down, feeling exhaustion begin to overtake him after countless sleepless nights spent constantly on the run.\n\nWith his eyes closed, he was about to fall asleep, but a sharp blow to his head with a rifle butt preempted his desires. Losing consciousness, he collapsed onto the stone floor. Only after some time did he come to, finding himself in some vehicle with his eyes blindfolded and his hands bound...\n\nIt immediately became clear that he was in some kind of vehicle: the sound of the engine and the constant shaking were unmistakable indicators of his surroundings. Trying to do something, the scientist realized he couldn’t move much. Then he heard arrogant laughter from somewhere nearby, accompanied by the words: 'Well, the scientist’s awake. I thought my hit had sent him to the other side.' Then the entire vehicle erupted in mocking laughter. Fortunately, they soon arrived at their destination. Roughly pushing the bound man out, the operatives led him somewhere inside an unknown building.\n\nWalking who-knows-where, the scientist completely lost track of time. How long had he been in this state? It wasn’t clear... Finally, they sat him on a cold chair, removed the blindfold from his eyes, giving him a chance to look around.

But they were quickly reassured with words about the importance of this event and the lingering echoes of war. By evening, all the invitees had finally arrived at the palace.

We’ve walked a long and bloody path together. Now, I ask everyone to stand. You’ll hear the new anthem, – began her speech the girl who had taken the stage, pausing briefly.

Distorted, strange tones caused a slight murmur in the crowd. Abruptly, Homura swept her previously raised hand downward, shattering the glass. Security Forces soldiers raised their assault rifles and opened fire on the crowd. Screams of agony and the sounds of tearing flesh filled the air. The black-haired magical girl simply stood on the stage, watching as what she had 'built' in recent times crumbled in mere seconds. The orchestrated spectacle began to collapse at the hands of the theater’s director.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the chaotic gunfire ceased.

However, the magical girl hadn’t come here to admire the evening city—she needed Kyubey to come to her. Her pistol was already at the ready.\n\n– Akemi Homura, did you call for me? – the alien creature appeared as if out of thin air once again.\n\n– Yes, I have a couple of extremely important questions. You’ll answer them, won’t you? – Homura replied emotionlessly.\n\n– Of course, I’ll answer what I know, – came the voice. As usual, Kyubey didn’t even open his mouth.\n\n– Good. How do you Incubators hide from human sight and only appear to magical girls?\n\n– We had technology that allowed us to tune into the brainwaves of the people we needed.\n\n– Had? – Homura’s eyebrow rose. – Tell me more. And another question: how many of you are there across Germany and the world?\n\n– We lost that technology a few years ago. Now we can distort light streams for a limited time. By your definition, it’s invisibility, – he replied, circling around like a cat. – The number of Incubators outside Germany is unknown; we have no contact with them. In Germany, there are about fifteen thousand of us.\n\nHearing all this, Homura’s face twisted into a smirk. At that moment, one of the Kyubeys’ bodies was riddled with bullets. Within a couple of days, squads of soldiers were running across Germany, hunting for white creatures with rings on their backs. They were now visible to everyone, though they still hid.

It didn’t resemble a typical checkpoint but rather a military observation post. Messages about the car intending to cross the border of the 'Zone' had been sent in advance, so the informed soldiers didn’t open fire.\n\n– Ojou-sama, we’re approaching France. Are you sure about what you’re doing? – asked the officer sitting in the front passenger seat.\n\n– Yes, I believe this will aid my goal, – Homura replied.\n\n– In ten minutes, we’ll cross the border. Everyone knows the crossing protocol, – the driver spoke up.\n\nPulling up to the border, the officer stepped out to the soldier and began showing various papers confirming the departure. After carefully reading through all the contents, the soldier gave a military salute and ordered the barriers to be raised. As if in some science fiction movie, sturdy iron gates began to open, accompanied by the glow of red lamps on either side. The officer returned to the car, and the group drove into France.\n\nHomura, who had been sitting in the back seat the whole time, suddenly felt an unusual weakness. 'No... why?' – the girl thought, clutching her forehead, which felt intensely hot. Her eyes began to close on their own despite her desperate attempts to resist her body. Ten minutes later, the magical girl passed out.\n\nOpening her eyes, Homura found herself in a familiar town hall, surrounded by a couple of officers and a person in a medical uniform. To her reasonable question about what was happening, they explained that the trip had to be urgently terminated because she hadn’t regained consciousness since crossing the border. There were even concerns that she had died, as her body showed no signs of reaction for several days. After they told her everything, the girl ordered them to leave her alone."

The description, habits—everything was specified down to the smallest detail so they wouldn’t miss the target. They had to find Madoka, no matter the cost.\n\nHomura’s desk was filled with various reports and observations from agents, but not one of them had managed to complete the task. The search zone stretched from Milan to Vilnius, yet nothing helped. Any leads turned out to be insignificant or outright falsified. Not a single agent brought the goal any closer.\n\nOf course, there were moments when Homura visited certain locations based on agents’ claims, but upon personal inspection, nothing matched up again. The information was either misinterpreted by the agents or by her. There were also a couple of cunning agents who, in pursuit of praise and career advancement, tried to pass off a completely random person as Madoka. Their fate for such brazen deceit and the effective insult to Madoka’s image was unenviable.\n\nAnother Security Forces officer entered the office. He was fairly high-ranking, which allowed him to report to Homura in person.\n\n– Ojou-sama, I have a report on the search in the Saxony-Anhalt and Kaunas regions. At the moment, there’s nothing, – the officer stated.\n\n– Günther, you’re not just eating your bread for nothing. Where’s at least something? – the girl asked the scout.\n\n– Sorry, Ojou-sama, but finding one specific person across such a territory is like looking for a needle in a haystack. We’re not even sure she exists or is alive! – the officer objected.\n\n– Shut up! I don’t care about the details; I only need results! – Homura snapped at the officer. – Get out!\n\n– Yes, Ojou-sama, – Günther replied, slowly leaving the office.\n\nAs soon as the door slammed shut, Homura sat back in her chair.

Broken windows hastily boarded up with plywood, walls riddled with bullet holes, shattered furniture, and the smell of death. Yet, despite all this, the office now felt more familiar than it had before the war.\n\nThere was nothing on the desk—no papers, no pens, no other attributes indicating any work. The only thing left was a revolver and a pack of bullets for it in the drawer under the desk. Homura opened the drawer and pulled out the weapon, a Soviet 'Nagan,' its previous ownership betrayed by the five-pointed star etched into the handle. Loading one bullet into the chamber, the girl began twirling the revolver in her hand, examining it.\n\nAfter finishing the pointless inspection, Homura pressed the barrel to her temple and pulled the trigger. Click, empty. Click, empty again. Click, and a deafening bang erupted from the Nagan’s chamber. The bullet shot out of its slot, piercing the magical girl’s head clean through. Fresh blood trickled down her forehead and face, staining her hair and clothes. Homura slumped against the chair’s backrest, breathing heavily. The wound, which seemed fatal, began to slowly heal.\n\n'Three shots, not bad luck,' – the girl thought to herself. She didn’t dwell much on why she kept playing this roulette. After all, for a magical girl, no physical injuries were a threat—it was merely a waste of her magical energy on bodily regeneration. What was the point of this ritual of self-degradation? Homura saw it as punishment, punishment for still not having saved her, Madoka.\n\nNo matter what she did, no matter how hard she tried, it was all meaningless. What was the point of walking this path? Why had so much blood, sweat, and tears been shed? Sighing, Homura wiped the remaining blood from her face with her sleeve, stood up from the desk, and headed for the door."

In truth, everything around her seemed completely devoid of meaning. What was the point of everything she’d done if her main goal remained unattainable?\n\nThoughts overwhelmed Homura’s mind. Was this her punishment for trying to destroy the world that existed before her? Could it be some sort of purgatory after all? Years had passed, yet there wasn’t a shred of information about Madoka. Kyubey had said she was definitely in this world, but wasn’t that just another trick? Each subsequent step grew heavier and heavier. Had she done everything right? Or could the results have been achieved another way?\n\nHomura stopped abruptly—she only now noticed she was being followed. How long had they been trailing her? Was it a trap? Was someone about to attack? The girl reached to pull her pistol from her shield but stopped herself at the last moment. Even if it meant certain death, maybe she shouldn’t resist? The magical girl spun around 180 degrees and shouted into the air: 'Come out!'\n\nKicking up dust, a light-brown-haired girl appeared before her. She looked a few years older than Homura and nearly a head taller. Her unusual outfit, resembling ancient armor, marked her as a magical girl. In one hand, she held a spear, and in the other, a thick folder stuffed with papers.\n\n– Who are you? – Homura spoke first.\n\n– Apologies for the intrusion. Maria Romanova—obviously, I’m a magical girl too, – the girl replied. – As I understand, you’re currently the ruler of all these lands?\n\n– Homura Akemi, yes, but what’s the point? When I can’t even sa– – she bit her lip at the last second.\n\n– You meant to say Madoka Kaname, right? For the past few years, I’ve been gathering information on magical girls and the strange events happening in the world.\n\nHomura’s pupils widened sharply. She lunged at Maria, grabbing her by the collar of her outfit. 'What do you know? Speak!' – the black-haired magical girl demanded, her voice trembling.\n\n– Calm down. All the information is in the folder, but it won’t be that simple. I’m ready to help you, so could you at least let me go? – the other magical girl replied in a calm tone.\n\n– Sorry, I got worked up. What can you tell me? – Homura released Maria, stepping back and brushing her hair with her right hand.\n\n– Let’s discuss everything somewhere else, – Maria replied with a smile."

Trailing the magical girl in ancient armor, paranoia kept Homura from calming down. After nearly 20 minutes of walking, Maria stopped in front of a door with a heavily worn sign. 'Well, here we are,' – the girl said and opened the door. Homura, staying silent, followed her inside.\n\nThe place the two magical girls entered couldn’t be called luxurious, but it didn’t resemble some underground headquarters either. Rather, the interior looked like a bar or a simple café. Maria approached a tall German standing behind the counter and said: 'Franz, clear out the regular patrons.' With the words 'Sorry, the café is closing,' people began grumbling as they got up from their seats and left, leaving the room empty.\n\n– Sit wherever you like, it’s safe here, – Maria said, returning to Homura.\n\n– Fine, so what do you know? About Madoka, – still on guard, the black-haired magical girl approached a random couch.\n\n– Hold on, let’s take it step by step. It’s not as simple as you think, – Maria replied, placing the folder on the table.\n\nClicking her tongue slightly, Homura chose to stay quiet, letting Maria explain everything necessary. In turn, Maria began clarifying all the details about what had happened in this universe. With each new document, a puzzle started forming in Homura’s mind. Things began to make sense, if only a little. However, the question 'What about Madoka?' lingered. Just as she was about to ask, Maria, as if anticipating it, said: 'Project "Captured God," also known as Madoka Kaname.'\n\nFinishing her explanation of all the key documents, Maria stood up and extended her hand to Homura.\n\n– We need to put an end to all the anomalies, and you’ll finally save Madoka, – Maria said.\n\n– Yes, of course, – Homura replied, shaking the offered hand."

GWF.57.t: "An Unusual Encounter"
GWF.57.desc: "Homura... was doing nothing. She wandered aimlessly through Stuttgart’s nighttime streets, rarely paying attention to the ongoing construction or charred ruins. The wind lifted ash and dust into the air, tickling her nose. Where was she going? Why, and for what purpose? All these questions were utterly meaningless. In truth, everything around her seemed completely devoid of meaning. What was the point of everything she’d done if her main goal remained unattainable?\n\nThoughts overwhelmed Homura’s mind. Was this her punishment for trying to destroy the world that existed before her? Could it be some sort of purgatory after all? Years had passed, yet there wasn’t a shred of information about Madoka. Kyubey had said she was definitely in this world, but wasn’t that just another trick? Each subsequent step grew heavier and heavier. Had she done everything right? Or could the results have been achieved another way?\n\nHomura stopped abruptly—she only now noticed she was being followed. How long had they been trailing her? Was it a trap? Was someone about to attack? She reached to pull a pistol from her shield. The Walther P38, now a familiar companion, was in her hand, safety off. Turning around, she aimed the gun into the void. 'Come out!' – the magical girl shouted, firing straight ahead.\n\nKicking up dust, a light-brown-haired girl appeared before her. She looked a few years older than Homura and nearly a head taller. Her unusual outfit, resembling ancient armor, marked her as a magical girl. In one hand, she held a spear, and in the other, a thick folder stuffed with papers.\n\n– Maria Romanova, magical girl, – the uninvited guest said sharply. – As I understand, you’re currently the ruler of all these lands?\n\n– Nice to meet you, but what do you want here? – Homura replied, ignoring her question.\n\n– Nothing special, just doing you a small favor. Even despite everything you’ve done, – Maria shot back.\n\n– What’s it to you? I live only to protec– – she bit her lip at the last second.\n\n– Madoka Kaname, right? I’ve been gathering information on the strange events happening in the world, and there’s plenty about her that’s useful, – pulling out the folder, the light-brown-haired magical girl tossed it into the dirt at Homura’s feet. – I hope we never see each other again.\n\n– Wait! – Homura shouted, firing a couple of shots at the vanishing silhouette in ancient armor. Sighing, she carefully picked up the folder and brushed off the dirt. On the title page, written in pencil, was 'On the Rupture of the Universe.'"
GWF.57.a: "A Gift of Fate?"

GWF.58.t: "Plans, Plans, and More Plans"
GWF.58.desc: "Homura didn’t want to return to the town hall; all associations with that place had long taken on a purely negative hue. But in practice, it was her office and a place where she could issue orders and immerse herself in her thoughts. Entering the building, the crunch of plaster and the creak of the floor under her feet were the only sounds accompanying Homura. Climbing to her office, she locked the door, pushing a large cabinet against it. Dim lighting, papers strewn across the floor, and boarded-up windows—that’s what the room looked like now.\n\nApproaching the desk and sweeping everything off its surface, the magical girl placed the folder down and sat on a nearby chair. 'On the Rupture of the Universe, huh,' – she whispered, staring at the cover. The ribbon holding the folder together was quickly torn off, revealing a massive stack of papers, documents, reports, and diary entries. It seemed even several days wouldn’t be enough to read it all. Homura began studying the papers, starting methodically from the top.\n\nSheet after sheet, page after page, Homura started to realize this was her personal Holy Grail, explaining nearly every detail. The meticulousness of the collected materials astonished the magical girl. She couldn’t believe it was possible, but it was real. Some documents sent shivers down her spine—almost the entire time, she’d been under surveillance by the intelligence agencies of major powers. Yet, so far, there was no information about Madoka...\n\nAs midnight approached, more than half the papers had been read, and despair began creeping back into Homura—there was nothing personally useful to her there. Thoughts of abandoning the reading started to emerge, but the magical girl resisted them. And then... the next sheet flashed a heading: 'On the Ahnenerbe Projects on Bornholm Island.' One of those projects was 'Captured God'... The description was scant, but for Homura, everything became clear anyway. Now she searched for any mention of this project in the remaining documents.\n\nBy morning, the entire folder had been read. All the anomalies tied to Bornholm and its surrounding areas formed a cohesive picture. Madoka was there. That was certain. Her final battle would finally begin."
GWF.58.a: "'Bornholm, then'"

GWF.59.t: "The Beginning of the End"
GWF.59.desc: "Homura was at a small military airfield near Hamburg. She paced circles around an old piston-engined 'Junkers.' This was the plane she’d use to reach her final destination—Bornholm Island. A couple of engineers inspected the transport’s engines and propellers, ensuring the aircraft was fully operational. An older man in a pilot’s uniform approached the girl walking along the runway.\n\n– Sieg Heil, Akemi-sama, I’m ready to take you wherever you command, – the pilot said, raising his right hand.\n\n– I think I can handle it myself, – Homura politely declined. She didn’t know how to fly a plane directly, but with magic, she could manage.\n\n– Don’t underestimate me. Back in the day, Herr Göring himself shook my hand. It’d be my greatest duty to carry out this mission, – he declared, striking his chest.\n\n– Hm, alright. You understand this task could be deadly? – the magical girl replied. – Prepare for takeoff.\n\nIntelligence reports mentioned a magical barrier over Bornholm that disabled all technology within a twenty-kilometer radius. Fragmented messages spoke of a pink spherical field and strange arrows. Homura didn’t fully trust the contents of these reports, but deep down, she felt a warmth that Madoka was somewhere close, and she was now definitely on the right path.\n\nAn hour later, the plane was in the sky. The view from the window revealed the endless Baltic Sea. The fuselage was empty except for Homura. She sat silently, gazing at the landscape. About forty minutes remained until Bornholm. After a while, the view outside transformed—black clouds engulfed everything. The plane began shaking violently and uncontrollably. The magical girl, gripping parts of the fuselage tightly, made her way to the cockpit.\n\n– Damn it! It’s gone unresponsive; the controls won’t budge, – the elderly man shouted into the void, accompanied by radio static. – Mayday, mayday.\n\n– Pilot, what’s happening? – Homura interrupted as she entered.\n\n– This shouldn’t be possible; a storm front can’t appear in a minute! What’s that glow on the ground? Lord, – the pilot replied, frantically pulling levers.\n\n– Try to climb as high as you can. I’ll handle the rest, – the girl shouted.\n\nThe pilot, without a single objection, yanked the controls toward himself. The plane sharply gained altitude. Once Homura felt she could successfully reach the island, the magical girl headed to the fuselage door. With immense effort, she opened it, slung a parachute onto her back, and stepped out of the plane to meet her fate."
GWF.59.a: "I’m Coming"

GWF.60.t: "The Landing of One Person"
GWF.60.desc: "A fierce wind struck Homura’s face. The fall from the plane seemed to last an eternity, with the ground barely becoming clearer with each second. At a height of several hundred meters above the island, the magical girl froze time and deployed her parachute. Only now, through the dark clouds, did she see arrows suspended in midair—arrows that, had she hesitated even a second, would have riddled her during the descent. Carefully maneuvering, Homura finally felt solid ground beneath her feet. Time resumed. The arrows aimed skyward continued their flight.\n\nThe magical girl landed on one of the island’s rocky beaches. Climbing the only elevation—a tree—she began surveying her surroundings. The landscape was... highly unusual. Abandoned villages and towns, oddly shaped small lakes, fragments of a mansion as if sliced cleanly with a knife. But at the center stood seemingly unremarkable buildings. They appeared to be just an abandoned local military garrison base. Yet, even from ten kilometers away, Homura could sense immense energy radiating from there.\n\nAlmost unconsciously, her legs carried the magical girl in that direction. Trudging through mud and dense forest, she reached the base by evening. The sky had become strikingly clear, as if welcoming its guest. Walking along slightly overgrown asphalt paths, Homura spotted what could be called an entrance to an underground complex. Again, it seemed utterly unremarkable, but somehow she’d stumbled exactly where she needed to be.\n\nOpening a heavy steel hatch, the girl descended a dimly lit staircase. As she went further down, the narrow steps gave way to a wide underground research center. White lighting, a slew of old tube computers, various calculations on chalkboards. But something was clearly out of place—a section of wall with a door, as if from an old mansion, carelessly 'inserted' at the end of the hall. 'I hope this is what I need,' – Homura whispered. Taking her pistol in hand, she approached the door. Beyond it was a tea room, with windows opening to a view of boundless space."
GWF.60.a: "What Is This?"

GWF.61.t: "The Last... Battle?"
GWF.61.desc: "The room still struck Homura’s imagination; something like this absolutely shouldn’t exist, not in the slightest. Yet, this was undeniably reality. What was this place? A portal to another world, yet another anomaly, the final answer to all her questions? As the magical girl sank into these thoughts, a tall woman dressed in a pink kimono materialized before the table as if from thin air, a steel semicircle floating around her head.\n\n– Welcome, Akemi-san, – the stranger began, – I can congratulate you.\n\n– Who are you? Where’s Madoka? – Homura replied. – Answer me!\n\n– My, my, such tactlessness. She’s right beyond this room. But before that, wouldn’t you like to have some tea and eat soft French rolls? – the woman responded gently. – I’m Featherine Augustus Aurora. Pleased to meet you.\n\n– Sorry, I don’t have time for this. I’m in a hurry, – the magical girl snapped back. – Just answer a couple of questions instead.\n\n– Haha, alright. I have all the time in the world, but I won’t tolerate boredom. Will you surprise me?\n\n– Why did I end up here? How did all this even happen? – Homura began, barely holding back from shouting.\n\n– Hmm, Akemi-san, every story serves its purpose. For some, it’s interesting to see a character in an utterly bizarre situation; for others, it’s a chance to spill out their fragmented fantasies. For you, this is all real, but for someone else, it’s an unusual fiction. I’ll say this in closing: this book amused me. Sometimes it’s worth taking a break from sleep to read mediocre tales written by someone who seems to be trying their hand at literature for the first time. Well, now come the consequences, shaped by your decisions. Farewell, – Featherine said before vanishing into gray smoke.\n\n– Wait, what?... – Homura barely had time to grasp the meaning of that speech when the room dissolved. Now, before her stood a large steel door covered in various warning signs. Clearly, Madoka was behind it. But her hands began trembling traitorously; a sense of uncertainty and fear gripped Homura. Clenching her palms until they bled, the magical girl banished all extraneous thoughts. Closing her eyes, her index finger pressed the button to open the door."
GWF.61.a: "Moment of Truth"

GWF.62.t: "Crimes and Punishment"
GWF.62.desc: "The sound of the door opening. The smell of a long-unused room. Homura didn’t want to open her eyes, didn’t want to find out what was inside. It was... the fear of the unknown. But she couldn’t stay in the dark forever, no matter how much she might want to. Her eyelids began to lift slowly, revealing the room. It looked like an ordinary laboratory: tables and computers on one side, and on the other... massive dusty capsules, within which two human-like silhouettes were clearly visible.\n\n'Madoka!' – Homura shouted and rushed to the nearest capsule. Wiping the glass and confirming it was indeed her, the magical girl fell to her knees. A veil of tears clouded her eyes; it felt like Madoka might vanish again any moment. Suddenly, that thought stabbed at her heart. No, Homura couldn’t lose her again—not under any circumstances. The question remained, though: how to get her out of the capsule? Approaching the computers opposite them, the magical girl turned them on. Luckily for her, there were no passwords. 'If Madoka’s in one capsule, then the other holds the law of the cycle,' – Homura whispered.\n\nThe capsule with Madoka began to open slowly, an unknown liquid spilling out. Rushing back to it, Homura caught Madoka before she could fall from the capsule onto the floor. Gently setting her down, the pink-haired girl’s eyes fluttered open slightly. 'Homura-cha...' – she whispered faintly before closing them again.\n\n'Don’t worry, Kaname Madoka, I’ll save you,' – Homura replied, swallowing her tears. The magical girl glanced at the neighboring capsule with the 'divine part,' but quickly looked away—it wasn’t someone worth saving. Holding Madoka tightly, Homura suddenly felt an immense surge of power. The space around the two girls began to fracture and distort. Yes, this was it—the universe was being rewritten again. Soon everything would be back to normal, right?\n\nA flash. The underground laboratory’s scenery shifted to the familiar urban landscape of Mitakihara. Homura found herself right in front of the Kaname house. But something was off—the house seemed utterly lifeless and abandoned. A newspaper suddenly stuck to her leg. Glancing at the headline and the accompanying picture, Homura’s face twisted in horror. 'Brutal Murder of a Family of Four... No! No! No!' – a desperate scream echoed down the street. The space began to collapse again, the universe rebooting once more."

Uncertainty seized the magical girl’s mind, but she couldn’t keep running from the end forever. Wasn’t this the moment she’d waited for so long? Her eyelids began to lift slowly, revealing the room. It looked like an ordinary laboratory: tables and computers on one side, and on the other... massive dusty capsules, within which two silhouettes were clearly visible.\n\n'Madoka!' – Homura shouted and rushed to the nearest capsule. Wiping the glass and confirming it was indeed her, her hands instinctively reached for the capsule. The magical girl couldn’t believe she’d ever manage to find her. She’d never let her go again—never. Wiping her eyes with her hand, the question arose: how to free her from this strange prison? Approaching the computers opposite them, the magical girl turned them on. Luckily for her, there were no passwords. Typing a command to open both capsules, a strange liquid began to flow out of them.\n\nRushing back to the capsule, Homura caught Madoka before she could fall to the floor. For some reason, the second capsule was empty. The magical girl gently sat the pink-haired girl down, and her eyes began to open slowly. 'Homura-chan...' – she whispered, a faint smile appearing on her face. Homura hugged her tightly, saying: 'Everything’s alright, Kaname Madoka.' The space around the two girls began to fracture and distort, but it abruptly stopped. Madoka opened her eyes again; the golden hue in them had faded once more.\n\n– We didn’t go back? – the pink-haired girl asked quietly.\n\n– What do you mean? We’re still in... this laboratory, – Homura replied. After a couple of seconds, it dawned on her what Madoka meant. – Were you trying to restart the universe?\n\n– Sorry, I wanted to make everything the way it should be.\n\n– Don’t apologize for that. It’s okay, – the black-haired magical girl said, embracing her."
GWF.63.a: "Now Let’s Get Out of Here"

GWF.64.t: "Putting Things in Place"
GWF.64.desc: "The sound of the door opening. The smell of a long-unused room. Homura didn’t want to open her eyes, didn’t want to find out what was inside. The unknown was frightening, but it also heralded the start of something new. After all, this entire journey hadn’t been for nothing—her long-set goal was so close now. Gathering all her resolve into her fist, the magical girl opened her eyes, revealing the room. It looked like an ordinary laboratory: tables and computers on one side, and on the other... massive dusty capsules, within which two silhouettes were clearly visible.\n\n'Madoka!' – Homura shouted and rushed to the nearest capsule. Wiping the glass, she confirmed it was indeed her. The magical girl couldn’t believe she’d ever manage to find her. A faint veil covered her eyes; it had seemed like an unattainable dream. But here was Madoka, right in front of her. Wiping her eyes with her sleeve, the magical girl approached the neighboring capsule. As she’d suspected, it held another Madoka—the divine part, the 'law of the cycle.' At that moment, a sharp, explosive pain struck Homura’s head.\n\nThe room filled with black smoke, which began to condense into a silhouette. At first, Homura couldn’t make out who it was, but realization hit quickly. It was the 'Devil,' created by none other than herself.\n\n– Interesting. Looks like I’ve split too, – the doppelgänger spoke, holding Homura’s soul gem in her hand. – You did well.\n\n– What are you doing? Explain! – Homura shouted as the capsule with the 'law of the cycle' began to crack.\n\n– Calm down. Devil and God separate, ordinary humans separate. It all seems logical, – the 'Homura' continued, crushing the soul gem. – Time to sort out this mess.\n\nThe space around them began to fracture and distort. Homura and Madoka were caught in a whirlwind of spatial fragments and orbs bearing the faces of other interlopers. With each passing minute, they drifted in their own directions as the space restructured itself. A flash. Darkness veiled Homura’s eyes—no, they were simply closed. Somewhere to the side, an alarm clock beeped, signaling morning. By muscle memory, she groped for her phone and turned on the screen. Date: May 1, 201X. A message from 'Kaname Madoka': 'Will you be at school today? I’m worried.'"
GWF.64.a: "The Long-Awaited Finale?"

GWF.65.t: "Curtain"
GWF.65.desc: "Homura lay on the damp ground somewhere in Stuttgart’s industrial district—or rather, what remained of it. The surrounding landscape now consisted solely of charred ruins. Raindrops spread across the magical girl’s face, mixing with the mud. She couldn’t remember anything that might have led her here. And now, she felt nothing but a searing pain radiating through her entire body. In her hand lay her soul gem, its color far from normal.\n\n– Almost... black, – Homura whispered, glancing at it. There were no grains of despair nearby, nor anything else. In this universe, she was neither 'God' nor 'Devil.' Like all magical girls, she too could succumb to despair.\n\nTilting her head back, a barely audible laugh escaped her. Was it a laugh of pain, despair, or self-mockery? She tried to crush the soul gem to end it all right then and there. But her hands stopped obeying her; her left hand unclenched, and her own soul rolled into the mud.\n\n– Haa, I’m a horrible person, – Homura chuckled. – Is this my hell? Sorry, Madoka...\n\nWith those final words, the soul gem shattered, releasing thick smoke that engulfed all of Stuttgart within minutes. The city turned into an eternal funeral procession, led by a witch with part of her head severed. Chaos and destruction swept over the city. The only person remaining calm was a light-brown-haired girl, about nineteen, standing atop the TV tower.\n\n– And so the fairy tale ends, – she said, gripping her golden spear."
GWF.65.a: "Fin."

GWF.66.t: "The End of the Performance"
GWF.66.desc: "Fatigue. That single word could describe everything Homura had been feeling lately. A warped universe, running a country, searching for Madoka. Too many problems had piled onto Homura all at once, and until recently, she’d managed to cope. But even someone who called themselves the 'Devil' couldn’t escape exhaustion. The black-haired girl slowly paced the corridors of the town hall. Her eyes were drooping, but each time, she shook her head to ward off sleep. 'I’ll sleep when it’s all done,' – a faint whisper escaped her lips.\n\nHeading to her office, Homura didn’t hear the subtle crackling inside. 'Probably the wind,' – she said, opening the door. Reaching her desk, the magical girl collapsed into the chair, tilting her head back. Papers, reports, and some of her notes lay scattered about again. 'Tick-tock, tick-tock,' – the nearby clock marked its rhythm. As the time approached two in the morning and the minute hand hit twelve, the chime of bells rang out. Something lying under the desk exploded.\n\nA bright flash illuminated the office, sending burning papers flying through the air. Homura, seated right above the bomb, was hurled toward the windows. A dull pain radiated from her lower body; her legs had turned into a bloody mess of charred flesh, bones, and skin. Her body began regenerating, but the process was agonizingly slow. Her shield appeared on her arm—stopping time was the priority now. But then, a golden spear pierced it, preventing her from doing so. A figure shrouded in shadow and dust began to emerge. A light-brown-haired girl, about a head taller than her, stared down sternly.\n\n– Who are you? – Homura spoke through gritted teeth and pain.\n\n– You don’t need to know that. Sorry, – the unknown magical girl replied. In her free hand, she held a large revolver.\n\n– So, I’ve lost without even a fight? No way! – Homura tried to pull something from her shield with her other hand, but two shots pierced her elbow, nearly severing her arm. – Tsk, Mado–\n\n– It’s pointless. Sorry, – the stranger said, aiming the barrel at the hand holding her soul gem. A single shot ended the magical girl’s life in an instant, leaving only a mutilated corpse.\n\nThe girl walked out of the office, pulling out a radio. 'Target "Night Flame" eliminated. Hope you’re satisfied in Langley,' – she said into the crackling microphone. Tossing the radio into the air, she destroyed it with a swing of her spear."

The task was simplified by the fact that the headquarters building was designed like a trap with only a few proper exits.\n\nUnder the cover of night, she swiftly moved through the city toward her target. No one paid attention to the girl leaping between rooftops. After about ten minutes, she was there. According to gathered intel, a meeting of the rebel command staff, including their leader Otto Ernst Römer, was taking place right now.\n\nFreezing time, Homura slipped inside the building. It’d be inconvenient to start a bloodbath in the middle of the city. Entering the meeting room, she carefully placed the explosive packs under the table, maximizing potential damage to the resistance leaders if things went south.\n\nStanding behind Römer, she let time resume. Clapping her hands, Homura addressed everyone in the room.\n\n– A moment of your attention, please, – a stern female voice rang out. – No need to panic or resist. There are several kilograms of TNT under your feet right now, and it’d be quite awkward if this place blew sky-high.\n\nSilence fell over the room; no one dared move. If she could rig the entire room with explosives out of nowhere, no one wanted to test what’d happen if they fought back. In an instant, the girl positioned herself behind one of the movement’s commanders, facing their leader, Otto Ernst Römer.\n\n– Do you now see that resistance is futile? – Homura asked the general.\n\n– Y-yes, I see that now. What are your demands? – Otto replied.\n\n– Simple. You cease all resistance and lay down your arms. In return, I’ll make some concessions too. Sounds like a fair deal, doesn’t it?\n\n– I... alright. I request we put the matter of fully laying down arms on the agenda, – Römer calmly addressed the rest of the command. Everyone cautiously raised their hands in agreement. – Unanimous.

Climbing onto the roof of a neighboring building and hiding behind a brick chimney, she let time resume.\n\nThe pre-fired rockets sprang into motion, demolishing the upper floor of the headquarters. Chaotic gunfire and piercing screams erupted from within. Twisting her shield again, she entered through the gaping hole in the wall. Pulling a rifle from her shield, she took precise shots at the heads of everyone inside. The only person spared an imminent bullet to the skull was Römer himself.\n\nTime resumed, and nearly two dozen people in the building dropped dead in an instant. A tall, elderly man jolted in horror, glancing around wildly.\n\n– You, you!

No, I won’t die by your hand, demon! – Römer yelled, reaching into his pocket for cyanide capsules. But before he could grab one, a bullet pierced his forehead.\n\n– Wanted to go out on your terms?

Though everything seemed laid out perfectly, something told her it wouldn’t be that simple. The whole situation felt like either a trap or a clever ruse. Attempts to devise a plan fell apart; every scenario crumbled when she mentally played it out. In the end, she decided to improvise.\n\nFreezing time, Homura headed to a large house on the village’s outskirts where the communist leaders were converging.

Before her was a small room packed with fifteen people; even in frozen time, the chaotic atmosphere was palpable.\n\nHomura pulled a pistol from her shield and prepared to fire into the air.

The basement led to a tunnel connecting to a neighboring house. After a brief sweep of the houses, it became clear the meeting was being held in two locations simultaneously. The magical girl was prepared for such communist tricks, which was why she’d brought along a dozen mortars to shell the village.\n\nTen minutes after the meeting began, Homura pulled her artillery arsenal from her shield, and a barrage of shells rained down on the village. Explosions reduced the entire village to splinters. Once her ammunition ran out, the girl headed to the ruins to check the operation’s success. Approaching the charred walls of the 'main' house, she saw the bodies of nearly all the communist leaders, including Ensslin.\n\nThen Homura moved to the second house, but as she neared the entrance, a dozen bullets struck her back. Staggering slightly, she turned toward the shooter. Five meters away stood a bloodied Baader, holding an MP40 submachine gun.\n\n– What the hell! How aren’t you dead from that! – Andreas shouted, aiming at her again.\n\n– Didn’t they tell you I’m not human? – a voice replied from behind his head. In an instant, the girl appeared at his back, and he felt the cold steel of a pistol against his skin.\n\n– Haha, I don’t care who you are! I’d lay down my life for the righteous cau– – a shot cut off Baader’s speech.\n\n– Good riddance. Now it’s time to head back, – Homura sighed, walking away from the burning ruins."

GWF.72.t: "The Knight and the Devil"
GWF.72.desc: "After Homura defeated the communists of the Red Army Faction and the nationalists of the German Imperial Movement, only one organization remained to disrupt the state’s peace and hinder her goals: 'End of Times,' a coalition of magical girls dissatisfied with the regime. Lately, oddly enough, their activity had waned, but they still made their presence felt from time to time.\n\nIt seemed impossible to catch them, and the identities of their leaders remained a mystery. Homura sifted through various documents related to their activities, but nothing useful turned up. Interrogations of former RAF or GIM members also shed no light on the investigation.\n\nThe door suddenly burst open, and a breathless Hans Filbinger rushed in, clutching a long wrapped stick and a piece of paper. 'A... message for you...' – the official panted. Homura nodded and asked him to place the 'package' on the desk. Something metallic clinked inside the bundle. The letter invited her to a meeting at an Evangelical church. Unwrapping the package, she found a saber inside. 'Impossible,' – was the only thought swirling in the girl’s mind at the sight of its contents.\n\nLeaping from her seat, Homura immediately headed to the designated location. It could be a trap, and she fully understood she was willingly walking into this mousetrap. Arriving, the magical girl pressed herself against the wall of a nearby building to await the meeting.\n\n– You’re fast. I didn’t expect that from you, – a lively voice called out from above.\n\n– Miki, where the hell are you? – Homura began scanning her surroundings.\n\n– Listen, let’s use first names. It’s a different vibe, – the blue-haired magical girl replied, appearing right in front of her.\n\n– Fine... Sayaka, how did you end up here? Is the resistance your doing? – questions poured out.\n\n– As for how I got here, I know as little as you do. The resistance—you mean 'End of Times,' right? You guessed it, – Sayaka answered. – I thought you were somehow behind everything going on around here, but it seems I was wrong.\n\n– Lord, fine. What do you know about Madoka? Where is she?\n\n– No, I don’t know, – her voice dropped slightly. – I’m doing everything I can to find her too. We should join forces.\n\n– Us? Alright, do what you think is necessary."
GWF.72.a: "Deal"

GWF.73.t: "Collision"
GWF.73.desc: "After the regular factions were crushed, 'End of Times' grew more active. Their attacks became far more painful, but in doing so, they made their critical mistake—revealing their location. Their headquarters turned out to be a local cathedral.\n\nCatching on quickly, Homura prepared artillery and explosives for a swift destruction of the building and any potential catacomb network. Approaching the structure, shells and pre-planted bombs began exploding around her—the assault had begun. Bursting inside, Homura expertly fought through the magical girls, aiming precisely at their soul gems.\n\nAfter cutting down dozens of them, she started descending below. But as she stepped onto the first stair, several fire extinguishers detonated around her.\n\nA painfully familiar blue silhouette with a cape flashed before Homura’s eyes. As the extinguisher mist cleared, the organization’s biggest secret was finally unveiled—its leader. A girl with short blue hair, a white cape, and a sword in hand. There could be no mistake.\n\n– Miki... Sayaka, now it all falls into place, – Homura smirked to herself.\n\n– You... I couldn’t stop you earlier, my bad. But now, don’t expect mercy, 'newbie'! – Sayaka retorted, charging at her.\n\nA battle ensued. Homura deftly parried the sword strikes, but Sayaka skillfully cleaved through the bullets fired at her. At one point, it seemed the fight might end in a stalemate. However, Homura’s endurance began to prevail; Sayaka started making small mistakes. One, two, three—and she was on the floor, breathing heavily. Homura stood over her, pressing a pistol to her soul gem.\n\n– Your last words? – she asked, holding the barrel against the gem on her stomach.\n\n– Go to hell... – the blue-haired magical girl spat through gritted teeth.\n\nThe shot shattered the soul gem, and the last traces of life left her body. Without a doubt, Sayaka Miki was dead. Realizing nothing remained of the so-called 'End of Times,' Homura slowly walked away from the cathedral ruins and the surrounding district."

GWF.74.t: "In the Wasteland"
GWF.74.desc: "The universe kept restarting—again, and again, and again. With each cycle, the world around her warped further, but nowhere was Madoka alive. Circumstances changed, dates shifted, causes varied. One thing remained constant: the fact that she died before Homura could do anything. From her relentless attempts to resurrect Madoka by rebooting the world, this reality no longer even remotely resembled normalcy. Instead of urban landscapes, there was a desert—an endless desert beneath a brown sky.\n\nHomura could no longer—or no longer wanted to—rewrite the universe again. Silently collapsing onto the scorching sand, she pulled out her soul gem, which was strikingly pristine. Her hand instinctively clenched around it, trying to break it. A sharp pain seized her entire body, but her grip didn’t waver. Unfortunately, the gem didn’t react to the pressure. Other attempts to shatter it proved equally futile, as if it had become tougher than titanium. Throwing it away and walking off didn’t help either; at the last moment, it reappeared in her hand.\n\nThe magical girl sat silently on the sand, staring into the void of the sky. She wanted to die, somehow, anyhow, but the universe itself denied her that chance. 'Maybe this is the real hell,' – she mused.\n\n– Haven’t you considered that all this is your fault? – a voice spoke, its silhouette constantly shifting, making it impossible to discern any details.\n\n– Shut up. I did everything... to save Madoka, – Homura hissed.\n\n– Even if Madoka were alive, would she be happy with how that salvation played out? You just tossed your principles into the trash, didn’t you? Some savior you turned out to be.\n\n– I... I’m tired. Now I just want to die.\n\n– Can’t do that. The universe is too tied to your existence now. Death, in the classical sense, is an impossible luxury for you, – the entity said, glancing somewhere off to the side. – Everyone gets their own ending.\n\nHomura didn’t bother responding. Days turned into months, months into years. The girl, frozen in one pose, was neither alive nor dead. Thoughts ceased to form, her eyes grew vacant. Perhaps, in some distant future, someone would show her a way out, and she’d become the hero of a new story. But for now, only a shell and a perished soul remained."
GWF.74.a: "Hell Is Personal"

GWF.75.t: "The Perfect Cage"
GWF.75.desc: "A massive old mansion near Berlin looked better than ever. After nearly a decade of neglect, the weeds had been cleared, the gardens tidied, and the façade restored. Now, it served as the residence of Germany’s leader—Homura Akemi. Dozens of servants cleaned every room of the lavish main house, and the finest chefs had been assembled here. Nearly a thousand loyal Leibstandarte soldiers guarded the premises. This estate was the perfect place to spend the rest of her days.\n\nMorning sunlight began filtering into the bedroom. Homura was already awake, glancing at Madoka lying beside her. With a faint smile, she rose to carry out her now-standard routine. For the black-haired magical girl, every day was meticulously scheduled. Managing a vast territory single-handedly was no small feat, especially after she’d worked so hard to tear it all down. But now, with Madoka’s return, she realized there was no point in chasing the impossible anymore.\n\nIf Homura held power here, she might as well use it properly. Descending to the entrance and donning one of her uniforms, she went to meet the head of the country’s state security. Wilhelm Mönke had become her right hand and the executor of her will. The elderly officer approached with a folder in hand and began reciting the latest reports on bandit suppression, economic development, and diplomatic affairs. Tuning out nearly half of his briefing, Homura handed him a few sheets of decrees, after which he departed.\n\nThe magical girl headed to the second floor to check on Madoka. Fortunately for Homura, she’d forgotten about the failed attempt to restart the universe. Entering the bedroom again, Madoka sat by the window with a bored expression, her hair slightly disheveled, her pajamas wrinkled. The black-haired girl approached the window, leaning toward her.\n\n– Madoka, everything alright? – Homura started the conversation.\n\n– Oh, y-yeah, I can’t shake this feeling... that something’s off about all this. Like something’s wrong, – Madoka replied quietly.\n\n– Don’t worry about it. I’m here with you, – sensing the conversation veering off course, Homura’s hands wrapped around the shoulders of the seated Madoka, her face pressing against her cheek."
GWF.75.a: "Better Not Think About It"

GWF.76.t: "Searching for a Way Out"
GWF.76.desc: "Work buzzed anew in the underground research complex. Scientists darted from place to place, computers hummed, papers were printed. The brightest minds from around the world had been gathered here to study the phenomena that had unfolded in Germany and Russia in recent years. Dozens of anomalies awaited understanding and explanation. Amid all this commotion, two girls stood out, walking hand in hand through the research center’s halls at a leisurely pace.\n\nThey stood out the most, not dressed in the usual white lab coats but in loose hospital attire. Both of them—Madoka Kaname and Homura Akemi—were the most intriguing subjects for study. The near-divine powers of one and the time-freezing ability of the other had sparked immense interest among the scientists. After Homura relinquished state control to a civilian administration, the pair spent most of their time on the island, rarely leaving.\n\nSample collection, constant observation—it reached absurd levels. For the black-haired magical girl, it was even more burdensome than her days in Stuttgart’s town hall. But in contrast to Homura’s gloom, Madoka approached everything with calm and cheerful curiosity, which was soothing. Maybe it wasn’t so bad after all.\n\n– Akemi-sama and Kaname-sama, all necessary materials have been collected for now. You may leave the center for the time being, – a scientist with a slight French accent addressed them as he approached.\n\n– Thank you, Pierre. Contact us if we need to return to the island, – Homura replied.\n\n– Always happy to help! – Madoka exclaimed with a smile.\n\nBefore exiting the complex, the girls changed into regular clothes, shedding their patient uniforms. Holding hands, they headed to the surface. The ship that would take them back to the mainland was due in a couple of hours, and they’d already planned where they’d go and what they’d do. 'Do you think we can go back to Mitakihara?' – the pink-haired girl asked Homura.\n\n– Yes, we can, – Homura replied with a slight smile."
GWF.76.a: "Together"

GWF.77.t: "Ten Years Later"
GWF.77.desc: "Homura slowly climbed the stairs of an apartment building on the outskirts of Tokyo. She’d managed to get off work early today, so she stopped by a Seven-Eleven to pick up a small cake as a gift. Just because—no special reason. She didn’t want to overthink it. Rustling her keys, the door gave way, and the girl stepped into her home. Setting the store bag on the floor and neatly removing her shoes, Homura walked further down the hallway.\n\nSuddenly, something leapt onto her back, hanging there. Pink locks of hair on her shoulder immediately gave away the culprit. Turning around, Homura saw Madoka smiling adorably—it was unexpected, since they both usually got home late from work. Just as the black-haired girl thought the 'attack' was over, her lips met something soft and tender: the lips of the girl facing her.\n\nHomura’s face flushed with surprise and embarrassment, while Madoka giggled softly. 'Sorry, sorry, couldn’t help myself. That was my surprise,' – she said.\n\n– Looks like you got home early too, – Homura replied. – I got you a cake, though it’s no match for 'Recompense,' of course.\n\n– Yeah, there was a bit of downtime at Mom’s company today, so I slipped out early. How’s it going at the publishing house?\n\n– Really well. They brought in another story by Kotobuki Yukari for editing today. Those kids’ tales about a lion cub sell like hotcakes, – Homura sighed. – My historical novel might be a flop, though.\n\n– Homura-chan, don’t say that! I believe in you, – Madoka clenched her fists.\n\n– Alright, you’ve convinced me. Just a few final touches, and by the end of the week, I’ll hand it to the editors.\n\n– That’s the spirit! Let me brew some tea, and we’ll eat the cake together.\n\nHomura nodded, and they headed to the kitchen together. As always, the excellent green tea paired surprisingly well with the cheap supermarket cake. Truth be told, these little sit-downs didn’t happen often due to work and other responsibilities. By the time evening rolled around, it felt like they’d discussed the entire world—workplace oddities, Sayaka and Kyoko’s family life, the taste and production of cakes, tea traditions.\n\nAfter spending time together, Homura headed to her study. On the desk lay a large stack of papers titled 'Tsar and Soviets.'"

I used to run my business out of a one-room office not far from downtown Chicago. Well, I did until Germany got smashed into dozens of pieces, catching the attention of the fine folks at American intelligence. Without much fanfare, they recruited me into the CIA’s 'Division for Countering Extraplanar Threats to World Order.' And now here I am, in Red Dresden, hunting all sorts of nasties and trying to figure out what in God’s name happened to this godforsaken country.\n\nAnd this lovely lady in the chair to my right is Junior Constable-Occultist of the British Bureau of Silence, Constance Lee—though everyone calls her Connie. She’s been assigned to assist me, or rather, to school me in the workings of the occult world of the Old Continent.\n\nUnlike America, old Europe is teeming with places of power, letting adepts (that’s what they call wizards here) draw strength from history—or rather, from histories layered atop one another. Now, after a catastrophic energy surge from the most horrifying nuclear bombardment in history and a series of preceding temporal anomalies—whose source we’ve yet to pinpoint—other timelines and entities utterly impossible by any known laws of magic or physics have cropped up here, sending occult activity on the Continent through the roof."

But we’re offering you a shot at redemption, – I said as calmly as possible after dozens of minutes of talking to a brick wall.\n\nConnie, apparently having lost all faith in my diplomatic skills, appeared in the doorway with a wide grin.\n\n– The Lionforger’s boys, huh? Pretty bold, throwing around the names of secret gods. Then again, what else do you expect from a revolutionary? Didn’t the Lionforger win in your communist utopia?\n\n– We fought the Colonel’s scum back when they hid under the swastika, and now they’ve just swapped flags, – the cultist, tied to a chair, spat on the floor, his gaze sharp as a honed blade in that moment.\n\nConnie stepped right up to me and whispered, 'When’s a good time for you to step into the ring?' to which I replied without hesitation, 'Monday night.'\n\n– The Lionforger seems to appreciate a fair fight. How about a deal? Five of us, Monday night, at the warehouses on the city outskirts. You bring your five best fighters. If you win, you do whatever you want with us. If we win, you carry out a task and go free, – the constable laid out the terms, radiating confidence that spread to me like a virus, making me straighten my back."

My trust in meteorology paid off too—thunder rumbled, and rain poured heavily over the chosen warehouse. It’d been three days since we released the cultist here to relay our offer to his leader. Whoever he was, he couldn’t have refused.\n\nThe agents stormed into the warehouse through the wide-open door first, followed by me with my staff at the ready, while Connie leaned against the gate in the doorway. At first, it seemed empty—until we heard a wild scream in an unknown tongue. A mass of flesh and muscle appeared before us, two dozen wriggling... supernaturally alluring legs. The agents, likely as entranced by the sight and song as I was, stood still for a good minute before finally hacking the creature down with their blades, which took some time. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from its agony.\n\n'The Flayed Prophet,' – Connie tossed out. – 'A pretty clever distraction.'\n\nWhen the prophet’s song cut off, we heard another chant from a nearby building. Three voices sang the Thunder Rhythm. A moment later, the song stopped, and the right wall of the warehouse collapsed with a loud crash."

The Stasi agents charged at it but couldn’t match the creature’s perfect rhythm. A shaggy paw flung the first into a corner, the second took a massive, bleeding gash to the chest (I shudder to think how sharp the Percussigant’s claws were), and the third rushed to aid the second.\n\nIt was my turn to act. While the agents battled the bear—or rather, its animated hide—I prepared to channel the storm’s energy for a decisive strike. Under normal circumstances, that’d be suicide, but working for the law has its perks. A surge of energy burst from my staff and hit the creature, which was already dancing toward me, igniting its fur and disrupting its previously flawless rhythm.\n\nMy hands shook, but the flung-aside agent, back in the fight, drew the beast’s attention. Connie tended to the wounded one, while the third was nowhere in sight. The German adapted to the Percussigant’s now-erratic movements, and I backed him up with simpler combat spells.\n\nThen came a volley of rifle shots."

I felt my right shoulder shatter and an unbearable pain seize my left side. The agent fighting the creature took a bullet through the head. Barely aware of what I was doing, I channeled that pain into a final strike on the Percussigant, killing it. With my last strength, I reached for my shoulder and pulled out my OPIUM badge, enchanted to miraculously block bullet wounds. The bullet was still inside; I yanked it out with my left hand, aiming it toward where it came from, then collapsed.\n\nI heard Connie’s sidearm fire, the thud of a body dropping in front of me, saw two blinding flashes in the rafters above, and moments later, Stasi agents emerging from magical shadows tied up the stunned cultists. Connie rushed to treat my gunshot wound. I let out a satisfied breath and passed out."

Worms in the flesh, devouring anyone who got too close. These worms were wrong—his usual rituals yielded nothing. The Thicket and the Rag-Sun didn’t answer in this curse-ridden place. Luckily, he had weapons and monsters.\n\nBy day, when the Worms slept, he forged. By night, with the few strongest followers who survived the expedition’s horrifying first days and the monsters he’d crafted, he fought the spawn of Nowhere. He surveyed the ruined homes of what was once Germany’s eastern frontier and, before that, the beating heart of old Russia.

Fifty years ago, no one would’ve thought the former Gendarme of Europe would be reduced to a scorched wasteland. Yet it wasn’t even a desert. Deserts have life—underground springs, wells, snakes that can free you from this world with a bite. Here, Geiger counters went off the charts, and the only sounds were distant screams of agony.\n\nWhy weren’t they dead from hunger and thirst? Every wound is a door, and there are words that make sacrifice pleasurable. The Grail knows the art of indulgence and feasts. The prophets’ speeches carried anticipation of a day when these lands would bloom again, when life would return to the PEPEL valley. Before being devoured, they said that time was coming soon."

The closer the cultists got to Vyatka, the tauter the fabric of History became. Something had happened here, something that fractured the timeline.\n\nThey didn’t have to wander long among the remnants of old and new mansions and apartment blocks. Panther sensed someone watching him, and the seeker soon revealed herself: a young girl armed with a spear, dressed in something akin to a tunic. She looked no older than 19, but her face betrayed someone who’d seen much. Standing atop the former governor’s residence, she resembled a living statue of Athena Pallas, once adorning the local garden.\n\n– Greetings, travelers. I suspect you’ve come here seeking truth. In a way, so have I. My name is Maria, and I was once the tsarina of Russia, albeit in another world. Now, perhaps, I can be called that again.\n\n– Greetings to you too, young lady! – Panther’s tone, as always, blazed like a forge. – I’ll admit, I’m a bit stunned by your claims, and I don’t bow to tsars on principle. I reckon we can talk as equals here. – Maria nodded gently. – I really need to know what happened here. You mentioned another world, right? Germany’s crawling with folks like that, but the history here’s worn razor-thin.\n\n– Germany? I thought the whole world was like this after what happened on Bornholm.\n\n– The world’s in a state of utter j’ne sais quoi—pardon my French. Germany’s a mess; communists, Russians, and some magical girls popped up out of nowhere.\n\n– Magical girls? I need to get there, urgently!\n\n– Hold on, one small request?

The Russians vanished, and instead of princedoms and republics, a patchwork woven from who-knows-what emerged. The paths of Ulrike Meinhof, Andreas Baader, and Gudrun Ensslin diverged.

Many left behind only shadows on the scorched earth, but even that memory was buried under a massive layer of PEPEL. All of Siberia burned in an instant, showering Northern Eurasia with stench-soaked PEPEL. The few survivors suffer from countless diseases, dying as they’re eaten away from within.

Faced with despair, there are only two paths: sink deeper into the abyss, abandoning all hopes and dreams, or try to climb out of the pit with the risk of falling even further.\n\nHowever, this choice applies only to humans. Those who’ve bound their lives to a contract and become magical girls have no such luxury. Their despair is the energy that sustains the universe’s stability, part of the Incubator’s devilish bargain. Once negative emotions overwhelm a young girl, she ceases to be human entirely, losing even her shell. A witch - a being born of despair. Her purpose is to spread chaos and sorrow until she falls at the hands of another magical girl.\n\nFor Homura Akemi, turning into a witch wasn’t a one-time experience. In that past universe, she became a guinea pig for the Incubators in their quest to access the 'Law of Cycles.' Now, she has succumbed to despair again. But this time, there’s no one to help her. A massive funeral procession has spread across all of Stuttgart, claiming ever more victims.\n\nPerhaps someone merciful enough will end her suffering by killing the witch.

This path to calm is, of course, difficult and requires numerous compromises, deals, and conferences. But even a bad peace is far better than the best war.\n\nFor diplomats from Stettin to Rovno, the Copium Wars seemed like a chance to showcase their skills and end the conflicts without dragging the slaughter on for hundreds or thousands of days. Sitting everyone at one table to discuss the necessary details and compromises seemed like a brilliant solution. The most flamboyant figures dreamed of ending the war in 24 hours, but when the situation proved more complex than they thought, those diplomats turned it into a joke. Empty words and declarations couldn’t end the war - action was needed.\n\nAnd then, at some point, a breakthrough occurred. All sides agreed to freeze the front line without preconditions. There was cause for celebration - a true victory for shuttle diplomats and populist politicians. However... something went wrong. The universe took the phrase 'freeze' far too literally. At that moment, brutal cold swept over the entire theater of operations. The freeze truly came - all of Eastern Germany turned into an icy wasteland."

There are hundreds of answers to this question, none of which can be called definitively correct. It all depends on countless factors, sometimes utterly random and absurd. Some might be absolute egoists, others selfless altruists. Everyone acts in their own way.\n\nHowever, it’s hard to find someone like Homura Akemi. Ask her what she’s willing to do to save Madoka Kaname, and the answer would likely be 'everything.' That’s no exaggeration or complex metaphor. She who first gave up her soul, then spent nearly a decade trapped in a time loop, and finally rebelled against the very rules of the universe. She could be called the embodiment of determination and sacrifice for one single person. What drove such behavior? Duty? Attachment? Love? Obsession?\n\nNow, all these questions are pointless. Having gone as far as the fabric of existence allows, Homura destroyed an entire universe in her attempt to achieve her goal. It might have seemed the peak of madness was ruining a nation with a thousand-year history in pursuit of an already-dead royal family member. But in this case, the victim was everything in existence, including Homura herself. Now, nothing remains - just emptiness and a gray planet.

Few could endure so much grief and failure without losing their mind.\n\nHomura overcame trials that seemed impossible. And now, at last, she can rest in a new, peaceful world.
