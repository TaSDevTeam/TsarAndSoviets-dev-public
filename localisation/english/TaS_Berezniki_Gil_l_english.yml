 MAR_Solzh_Meet_the_new_boss: "Under New Management"
 MAR_Solzh_Meet_the_new_boss_desc: "We overthrew the madman Alexander Kazem-bek in almost bloodless way. The fact that no one even tried to stop us, except himself, says that we did everything right and we are supported in all endeavors! Now that such a distant province as Berezniki is under control again, we can begin to return it under the full protection of our Tsar Vladimir III. \n\nWe have to do not difficult, but necessary work to restore the country under the jurisdiction of our king. Get rid of traitors here and there, convince the wavering, stop the mess and only after that finally include Berezniki in its structure."
 MAR_Gil.1.t: "Welcome to Berezniki"
 MAR_Gil.1.d: "- We wiped off all the blood that was spilled in this office... Now he is rightfully yours, just like the Berezniki themselves,\" said one soldier from Solzhenitsyn's detachment.\n\n- Their experiment... this is abomination. Who in their  mind would cross holy monarchy with bloody soviets? And now you and I will have to clear Berezniki of this madness: to dissolve their services, destroy their henchmen, and also to clear the minds of ordinary subjects of Emperor Vladimir III of this evil! That's a lot of work...\n\n- Mr. Solzhenitsyn, Emperor Vladimir III has already sent you a large number of units to pacify the situation in Berezniki, you just need to use them correctly, - said the soldier, smiling.\n\nSolzhenitsyn turned to the soldier and answered him with a contemptuous smile:\n\n- That's right, that's right. Now I have to carry out state tasks, and you, soldier,\" he patted him on the shoulder, \"will be the new head of the squad, the Rescue squad.\n\n- Mr. Solzhenitsyn, it's an honor for me!  The soldier shouted with joy.\n\n- Enough words, we need to patrol the streets, look for Beck's loyalists and establish a new order. And we don't have much time for that.\n\nThe soldier, or rather the head of the rescue squad, understood Solzhenitsyn and quickly disappeared from the office. Meanwhile, the new head of the Provisional Governorship of Perm Krai only opened a window, looking at the city. The whole city, all the people in his hands, and nothing will stop him!"
 MAR_Gil.1.a: "There is a lot of work to do."
 MAR_Solzh_Block_MGB: "Dissolution of the MSS"
 MAR_Solzh_Block_MGB_desc: "Kazem-bek's MSS was a personal army \"oprichniks\" of the Berezniki. They sowed fear in the minds of the citizens of this small country, because they hunted those who were questioned Alexander decisions, as it was during the oprichnina of Ivan the Terrible. So Kazem-bek  jailed half of the country, where the other half would have guarded this archipelago of prisons and camps united by the common name \"Berezniki\", if not for our intervention. \n\nIf we want to get rid of the remnants of Kazem-bek's old power, then we should disband the MSS and eliminate those who did not accept the fate of his pseudo-ideology. They exude the evil that the late Alexander left behind, and therefore we must get rid of them at the root."
 MAR_Gil.2.t: "The Root of Evil"
 MAR_Gil.2.d: "Andrey Nesov was recently awarded the title of head of the Rescue squad. Previously it was “A paramilitary detachment of the Solzhenitsyn NTS,\" but now Solzhenitsyn has become the head of the Governorate, and they are a special squad. They even got their \"headquarters\", if you can call it that. It was dilapidated and dirty, but you can live and make plans in it. And suddenly Andrey got a call:\n\n- Yes?\n\n- Andrey, this is Solzhenitsyn. Today is an important day. Kazem-Bek loyalists have shown their heads, so now it's time to chop them off. You go to the building of the MSS, where loyalists with weapons are now located. There shouldn't be so many of them, so your special squad should be able to handle it. The order must be executed immediately. Everything should go like clockwork. End of communication.\n\nAndrey hung up the phone and gathered his fighters. There were about forty people in their special squad. They should be enough to just enter and take the building. There should be no resistance. Andrey and his squad climbed into the truck that took the squad to the building.\n\nThe building of the MSS, where Kazem-Bek's betrayal to the Emperor was planned, was in good condition. It was very quiet outside. Not a single soul. Only the wind interrupted this damned silence a little. The MSS building had seven floors. It was distinguished only by the huge letters \"MSS\", which can be seen everywhere in Berezniki. \n\nThe squad moved forward to the entrance very slowly. Everyone was ready, weapons were loaded, and the eyes of the soldiers were directed at the windows. However, this tense situation was interrupted by one of the soldiers:\n\n- You know, maybe there aren't here after all? Why do we have to walk so slowly? – said one of the soldiers, but after a couple of seconds sniper's bullet killed him. Everyone fixed their eyes on the seventh floor, and noticed the sniper. Everyone started randomly shooting at him, but he only quickly took cover. While they were distracted by the sniper, the machine gunners immediately got out and started shooting from above. The effect of surprise, the presence of shelters, as well as the presence of height predetermined the outcome of the battle. Andrei shouted a retreat, everyone ran to the truck, but many fell from a bullet. Only five people were able to reach the \"safe point\", and the driver quickly stepped on the gas. Everything would have been fine for Andrei and for the rest of the soldiers, if not for a stray sniper bullet that hit right into the truck tire. Everyone noticed it at a sharp turn when the car overturned.\n\nAndrey was one of the survivors, he was badly injured, but he was picked up by medics. However, he was no longer able to fight. Such a small special squad was defeated, and many already understood who would take up."
 MAR_Gil.2.a: "This is just the beginning!"
 MAR_Solzh_fuckup_tt: "§RWe're losing control ...§!"
 MAR_Solzh_catch_bandits: "Hunt down bandits"
 MAR_Solzh_catch_bandits_desc: "Kazem-bek was not able to establish order in any other way than to force his formidable name to be on the lips of all the people of the country. The whole population was afraid of Alexander's anger, which made everyone sit lower than grass and be more quiete than water, but recently his state  collapsed, and now bandits have become more active, who act to the detriment of not only the Berezniki themselves, but also our tsar Vladimir III. In addition, it is not so much the bandits themselves who went out on an open hunt, as there are still those who consider themselves a follower of Kazem-bek and do not want to put up with us. \n\nAll elements that oppose the new government to one degree or another, from small bandits to gangs – the formation of a certain Gil, will be outlawed and they will be subject to arrest. Our king is merciful, but he will not tolerate injustice and disobedience to him!"
 MAR_Gil.3.t: "Skirmish"
 MAR_Gil.3.d: "His Imperial Majesty unit entered the city of Solikamsk. The Emperor himself handed over this detachment to Solzhenitsyn for a while to pacify the situation in Berezniki. Recently, Solzhenitsyn signed a decree on the destruction of all sorts of bandits throughout the country, including all sorts of rebellious generals, namely Vladimir Gil. They say that he was able to take over a couple of thousand people from the former Mladorossi Army, but this is clearly exaggerated. These bandits were based in Solikamsk in order to weaken the Governorship by reducing profits due to salt extraction. But soon our brave fighters will destroy this sadomy!\n\nThe city was even too quiet, even though there was a curfew by Solzhenitsyn's decree. The soldiers entered the main square, where the Mladorossi flag was still blowing. Several people immediately took it down and put a real Russian flag on it. And again... no reaction. \n\n- It looks like they left the city, found out that we were going to catch them. That's what they are. Ordinary cowards!  The officer exclaimed in front of the soldiers. The soldiers immediately rejoiced at such a speech, but all this euphoria was interrupted by a stray sniper bullet that tore the officer's head. The soldiers were scared and shot at the windows to catch this upstart. Soon the main square was surrounded by Gil's soldiers. They were sitting in houses where civilians fed and watered them. The soldiers were immediately frightened and could barely stand on their feet.\n\n- Shoot. No mercy for the monarchists,\" Gil said, and the fire was opened.\n\nThe monarchists fought with dignity, but assault rifles quickly destroyed this detachment. A mountain of corpses was littered on the main square, and the imperial flag that these soldiers had set up fell on the corpses. Gil, together with the officers, climbed this mountain of corpses with the Mladorossi Flag and installed it. This time forever."
 MAR_Gil.3.a: "The Russian national revolution begins here."
 MAR_Solzh_speech: "Solzhenitsyn's speech"
 MAR_Solzh_speech_desc: "In order to strengthen our precarious position even better, we must address the Berezniki people directly. Many still do not understand what is happening, and someone only doubts the correctness of our own actions. These people can be understood and forgiven, and therefore we must speak personally on behalf of Solzhenitsyn to the people through the radio stations that are available in the country in order to convince people definitively of the good intentions of the board of the provisional governor of Berezniki, who is subordinate to Tsar Vladimir III himself. \n\nIn addition, in this way we will be able not only to convince the wavering, but also to sow thoughts of prudence in the truth of the monarchical system of our tsar in Berezniki, where until recently there was a abomination of the monarcho-socialist system."
 MAR_Gil.4.t: "The Incident in the Pub"
 MAR_Gil.4.d: "Egor Shcherbakov was the owner of a pub in the center of Berezniki. He opened it at the very beginning of the fifties, when he was still young. State investments helped him to stay afloat, and, thanks to this, his pub became one of the most famous in Berezniki. Although he had to give 80% of the entire profit of the pub, but the remaining 20% was enough for the wages of workers, for the purchase of alcohol and tobacco, and for his personal needs. The pub is not really a business for him, but a place for conversations. There you could talk to everyone, and they would hear you, understand and help. Everyone came here not for a drink, but for a conversation, even though drinking was a so-called \"good addition” to conversations.\n\nThere was a radio in the pub, which mostly broadcast various songs, but after Solzhenitsyn's coup, where not to switch: propaganda is everywhere. This has already annoyed many, including Egor himself. It was on this day that the patience of many broke. It was an ordinary evening, everyone was happy until the \"important message\" interrupted  peaceful time. \n\n- IMPORTANT MESSAGE! IMPORTANT MESSAGE! Solzhenitsyn's speech to the people of the Perm Governorate! – after that there was a pause of a few seconds. Everyone pricked up their ears, - Dear subjects! You have been freed from the sodomy that Kazem-Bek imposed on you. Now you can be happy! You are now under the protection of the real Tsar Vladimir III and his assistant, that is, me. We will free you from the Soviets that terrorized you now, and terrorized your fathers and mothers during Bukharin's time. We will free you from those groups that have destroyed the human spirit in you! God save the Tsar!\n\nSoon the radio turned on “God save the Tsar.\" But immediately one of the visitors turned off the radio and stood on the table:\n\n- Comrades! Several days have already passed since this barbaric coup! Did we want this? Of course not! Do we want to serve the German traitor Vladimir? Not either! They have taken away our freedom! They want to take everything from us! They only fool us with these sweet speeches, but we are not so simple. We know the truth and we will fight for it! We are the Russian people! We won't let the German mutts make us bow down to them! They didn't force us in 1917 and they won't force us today!Immediately, praising cries began, people took to the street and began to protest. And Egor himself, as well as the Berezniki, are going with a united front against Solzhenitsyn and his junta."
 MAR_Gil.4.a: "Everything is going to hell."
 MAR_Solzh_homecoming: "To the Home Harbor"
 MAR_Solzh_homecoming_desc: "It seems that's all now. We did the simple work that was necessary for the well-being of the Berezniki and in order to help them return to the bosom of the resurgent Russian Empire. Vladimir III is pleased with us, and the last thing we can do now is to return Berezniki to its native harbor. \n\nThe people in Berezniki and Vyatka perceive us as heroes. This whole Solzhenitsyn adventure will significantly strengthen the position of the NTS in the future, and will greatly simplify the task of building a solidaristic Russia. But that's in the future..."

 MAR_Gil_Broken_Economy: "Disturbed economic balance"
 MAR_Gil_Broken_Economy_desc: "The fragile and weak economy of our small country was broken by a political crisis and a two coups of power. Until recent events, our system resembled a symbiosis of cooperation between workers and enterprises, where at least some other good conditions for workers were created. However, with the arrival of Solzhenitsyn, this provision was violated and workers are striking against such inhumane labor standards.\n\nDue to the lack of guarantees of political and social stability, our economy cannot respond adequately in any way. In an attempt to survive, enterprises have stopped obeying decrees from the state."

 MAR_Gil_Collapsed_dream: "Destroyed Dream"
 MAR_Gil_Collapsed_dream_desc: "The dream of a great Russia under the banner of the people's tsar was destroyed by the harsh reality. The people no longer want to see any kings, even people close to them. In addition, such an early death of Kazem-bek put every cross before the realization of the true plan of the Mladorossi ideology. In the survival of the Berezniki, ideology has now receded into the background and now the need to preserve sovereignty at any cost has come forward."
 
 MAR_Gil_minus_moral_army: "Demoralized Army"
 MAR_Gil_minus_moral_army_desc: "The army was able to stop Solzhenitsyn, but at the same time confusion appeared in the army immediately after coming to power. There is no clear plan of action, and all this is compounded by an additional decline in ideological training in the army and a disturbed balance in the country's economy. Disruptions in food and equipment make people go robbing  their own citizens, which further contributes to the moral decay in the army."
 
 MAR_Gil.5.t: "Salt Upon Wounds"
 MAR_Gil.5.d: "Vladimir Gil is trying to gather at least some information about what happened in general during the time when Solzhenitsyn was in power in Berezniki. Literally a couple of days have passed since the new coup, and the government cannot be built up in any way properly. And so, for the first time, something began to work out for him.\n\n- Vladimir Gil! – The new adjutant, who was previously the general's deputy, and now a political adviser for his own appointment, addressed him. – I have prepared a report.\n\n- Report.  Vladimir Gil said calmly.\n\n– Very briefly: the situation is depressing. My people report that economic growth was broken by Solzhenitsyn's actions, and after the counter-coup. The people simply do not want to support us as well, there are rallies against the Mladorossi everywhere!\n\n– What about the army?\n\n- Our army as a whole supports us, but they also no longer believe in the Mladorossi idea. They openly oppose Vladimir from Vyatka, but they are against any tsar ruling our country in the future. In addition, there are units that start committing robberies and simply desert from our army.\n\nGil heard what he wanted to know. Even though the situation is deplorable, he was glad at least of the information that is available now. But from all this it must be concluded that Mladorossi was defeated in the form in which it was before. Kazem-bek made a mistake going this way.\n\n- Tell all our units and people that we will no longer have tsars. There will never be any more. The monarchy is outdated, and it cannot be strengthened in any way, and it should never again be recreated in any form on the territory of Russia. From now on, Mladorossi is about the Russian National People's Republic!"
 MAR_Gil.5.a: "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger."
 MAR_Gil.6.t: "Big Brother's Wrath"
 MAR_Gil.6.d: "Having lost such an important figure in the politics of the Vyatka Principality, Tsar Vladimir III was extremely angry about this. A restrained man of high culture could not contain his anger at the fact that the Berezniki had gone from under his hands, but Solzhenitsyn assured the tsar that everything would go according to plan. However, he did not take into account Vladimir Gil, and that's what happened. \n\negotiations between Vladimir III and the newly minted ruler of Berezniki, Vladimir Gil, took place for only 2 days. In the end, the tsar sent an ultimatum: either Berezniki will become part of Vyatka, or military take care of it. Vladimir Gil resolutely refused to fulfill the conditions of the ultimatum and cut off all communication with Vyatka. \n\nVladimir III was even more angry, but he immediately calmed down a little as soon as he realized that his hands were now untied and could attack Berezniki. \"So, you,\" the King seemed to be addressing Gil, \"have chosen death...”" 
 MAR_Gil.6.a: "To protect Berezniki!"
 MAR_Gil.7.t: "Ideological Brainstorming"
 MAR_Gil.7.d: "From Vladimir Gil 's speech to the Berezniki Government:\n\n\"Our state is now the only one in the vast expanses of Western Russia and there is no one left who could challenge our power. Nevertheless, you know my attitude to the issue, which has been growing more and more recently. I'm talking about ideological revisionism, which appears due to a clear misunderstanding of our \"Mladosocialists\".\n\nComrades, our party is filled with revisionists. They look at our idea, at one of our pillars of power \"from the wrong angle\", interpreting it as it pleases, extracting their own benefits from it! Those left-wing revisionists who want to cash in on the ideas of justice are starting to take all the property for themselves, and in fact, robbing our own people! Those on the right – they are starting to carry out almost genocide against our people, and this applies not only to minorities, but also to Russians! Because of all of them, we are in such a precarious position, which is why we still have resistance from the civilian population!\n\nAll this leads to great complications in the management of our country. All these traitors who exploit the gaps in our ideology should be removed from government! If necessary, we will renew the party, pour new blood into it, and those new people who will join our ranks will definitely fervently believe in our idea and will definitely follow it.\n\nBut, in addition, we will have to deal with our ideology, and if necessary, we will write not just another manifesto, but a whole volume that will fully explain the whole essence of our ideology. No one will dare to interpret it differently, and for a different interpretation we will punish to the fullest extent of our law.\""
 MAR_Gil.7.a: "We'll put everything on the shelves."
 MAR_GILe_Party_renovation_Manifesto: "Party Renewal Manifesto"
 MAR_GILe_Party_renovation_Manifesto_desc: "What we created a so-called \"Mladosocialism\", is a kind of hydra of fascism and socialism. This fact alone causes serious dissonance among the majority of the population, where for many people the image of fascism as such has an obviously negative, and the fact that we are trying to bring socialism into even greater chaos in people's minds. Even if we take into account that orthodox Mladorossi was still somehow perceived by the people, then Mladosocialism can already be interpreted as it pleases.\n\nUnfortunately, the manifesto was written in such a way that the point of  it understood only by Gil and Wilchkovsky. Everyone else is prone to revisionism both with a left bias and with a right bias, which in turn leads to great difficulties in the overall governance of the country. And, in addition, we need to establish a  order in the country, which which we created from poorly combined parts."

 MAR_Mladosocialism_Rise: "§BRussia will understand what§! §omladosocialism§! §Btruly means§!"
 MAR_GIL_DESC: "Vladimir Gil, despite all his obvious generalship talents, is a very mysterious figure with some kind of secret in his life. \n\nIn the summer of 41, he was captured by German troops, and abruptly he became one of the collaborators of the German occupation. It is not known what exactly prompted this to be done: whether it was a cold calculation for survival, or sincere hatred for Bukharin, but anyway, he began to serve not just in the ranks of the army of Nazi Germany, but in the ranks of the SS, organizing the first Russian national SS brigade \"Druzhina\". Gil himself took the call sign \"Rodion\". Nevertheless, the Soviet leadership did not know that he had switched sides, at least he was listed as missing.\n\nevertheless, the service in the SS was relatively short. At first, he effectively destroyed partisan detachments, but later his squad stopped coping with their tasks, and besides, obvious suspicions crept in that he himself collaborated with the partisans. We obviously won't know this anymore, only Gil himself knows the whole truth. For this, the command sent Gil to the border of the \"A-A\" line, and perhaps already at this time he figured out how he would switch back to the side of the Reds.\n\nShortly before the start of the West Russian War, he and his detachment switched sides with the West Russian Revolutionary Front, specifically in the area where Tukhachesvky was. To all questions about what he was doing, he said that he was in captivity and was forced to cooperate. They believed him, and he was immediately assigned to manage a couple of divisions that were under the command of the Red Napoleon. Gil himself, in addition to this, also handed over many of his  former employees, from which during the war they especially searched for certain persons for a long time in order to punish them in full. Sometimes, by the hand of Gil himself.\n\nAfter another defeat from the Germans,Gil found a glimmer of hope for the Russian people in the ideas of the Mladorossi, who were led by Kazem-bek, and eventually, 2 years after the end of the West Russian War, he secretly fled from the ranks of the Russian Communist Party and found himself in Berezniki."

 MAR_Gil.666.d: "Ministers Shafarevich and Serov, respectively the Minister of Economy and the Minister of State Security, were sitting near Gil's office. There was not a single soul in the corridor, which was quite natural, because there was only one office on this floor, namely Gil's office. He never liked unnecessary noise that interfered with his work. They discussed various problems and just had a heart-to-heart conversation. Earlier in Komi, they were ideological opponents, but now they are at the same time. They were able to find a common language.\n\nTheir conversation is interrupted by the rhythmic and booming steps of Gil and Wilchkovsky. Serov and Shafarevich quickly stood up to greet their Leader, raising their hand to the sun, but Gil did not pay attention to this. He just looked at them menacingly, hinting that there was an important matter ahead.\n\nEveryone entered the office. Gil sat down in his chair by the huge window, and three ministers were waiting for three chairs. The first one was located in the center, as well as opposite the Gil itself, it was brought directly from Italy. The second one was to the left relative to the first and was made more sparsely: birch was used instead of mahogany, but this did not prevent it from looking prestigious. The third chair was to the right of the first and it was no different from the usual one, if you miss the fact that it creaked. Vilchkovsky sat on the first chair, Serov sat on the second, and Shafarevich got the last one.\n\nGil began his speech:\n-My friends, the ministers. We are going through an important stage in the formation of the Mladorossi State, namely the establishment of a clear vertical of power. Establishing control over power is establishing control over people. This is the paradise that we must build, because people suffer from their freedom. Evil, betrayal and much more comes from a person. I hope you understand?\n\nEveryone except Shafarevich nodded their heads. Shafarevich said reproachfully:\n-Control over a person will turn him into an animal, and not into a conscientious person. We must set an example and guide him along the right path of becoming a superman, and not kill the "human" in him.\n\nGil took a little pause and began to answer:\n-At least I'm glad that we have common ideas, but different ways. And your main mistake is that you consider freedom to be truly human nature. The fact that it defines a person. Society and the surrounding world define a person. He is already dependent, and this dependence protects him from various troubles. Anyone who says that with complete freedom he will be happy is a fool. Therefore, our task is to protect him and let him live a conscientious and correct life. Therefore, I instruct Shafarevich to draw up something similar to a Table of Ranks, and I instruct Serov to follow the whole process and its execution. Everyone is free, except Wilchkovsky.\n\nShafarevich left the office first, almost like a bullet, Serov followed him out and closed the door. It is not known what Vilchkovsky and Gil were talking about, but this conversation with the ministers left an imprint in the memories of both Shafarevich and Gil."

 MAR_Gil.667.d: "The workers in the printing house printed every day, mostly newspapers and posters. Every day, from morning to evening, they printed as much as several villages and even one small town needed, in other words, they worked a lot. Despite the seemingly relatively easy work, it was necessary to constantly make sure that everything worked properly, and most importantly, that it was all of high quality in the end. Such were the demands of the workers on the part of the entrepreneur who was in charge of all this, but with all this, the salary of such hard workers was relatively small, and sometimes criminally small, considering how much they work. In addition, constant state-level orders were carried out by the leadership of Berezniki, Vladimir Gil himself, which also complicates the lives of already very busy workers.\n\nHowever, suddenly a lot changed in one day. A decree came to this printing house that now there will be changes all over the country, and they will begin here – from the printing press. Together with the resolution, sketches of posters arrived in the publication, which clearly made it clear that the worker and the bourgeois are best friends who have a real mutually beneficial cooperation between themselves. There are posters like "Strengthen the union of workers and entrepreneurs!" calling for such cooperation, and so on. There should be a lot of posters made, and therefore the workers immediately started working.\n\nThe entrepreneur, clearly fearing an inspection of this kind, when he realized that now the halcyon days of small payments to workers had passed, on the same day announced that he was increasing the salaries of all workers by more than one and a half times."

After what happened to Alexander Kazem-Bek, the return of power into the hands of the Mladorosses, now by the current leader Vladimir Gil, is seen as giving a second chance to the Mladoross idea. But it's not that simple. \n\nWe have a lot of problems right now. This is the most critical moment for the existence of Berezniki as such, and in order to survive, we will have to use all the forces we have and literally invent ways to solve the problems on the fly. It's up to us whether or not Berezniki will survive."

MAR_GILc_Calm_workers: "Calm Workers"
MAR_GILc_Calm_workers_desc: "Workers are not working now because they are concerned about what is going on in the country. The double coup has greatly agitated the very aloof Berezniki, and this has led to workers going on strike against the orthodox Mladoros idea with the Tsar and the Soviets. \n\nWe need to explain to the population that Vladimir Gil is not an orthodox Mladoross. From now on, Berezniki will not go the way of a decrepit monarchy with modernization in the form of councils. We will explain to the people that we will follow the new, Young Socialist road. After all - now is simply not the time to go on strike!"
MAR_Gil.8.t: "You can't stop now"
MAR_Gil.8.d: "Everything is ready for your speech, Minister Wilczkowski," said one of the officers.\n\n\n\n- Thank you. How many people have gathered at the factory? - Well, maybe five hundred or six hundred, maybe even a thousand. All in all, it's a lot of people. Even though they are charged with revanchism against Tsar Vladimir, but they must be convinced that we will not impose "the same kind of traitor Tsar," - began to answer the officer.\n\n\n\n-Hmm, everything goes according to our plan. It's time to address the people.\n\nWilchkovsky stepped out onto the balcony, which was about three meters above the ground. Down there were the usual workers who worked in the Solikamsk mines. All of them had their ears open and were waiting for the "right course" from the Mladorosses. Wilczkowski began his speech:\n\n\n\n- Workers! The time has come! The tsars and exploiters once took power over Berezniki. Alexander Kazem-Bek, the former head of Berezniki believed in the miraculous power of monarchism along with the Soviets. He was right that ordinary communism was weak in nature, and monarchism was destructive to the country. But he failed to take into account the fact that one cannot add even a drop of monarchy. There have NEVER been popular Kings or Queens. You can't trust those people whose dynasty has been on the throne for hundreds of years. They have become other people, they have severed their connection to the people. They only confirm their legitimacy with a "divine right" that never existed! Today our little fatherland fights against Vyatka and her false czar. What they did when Solzhenitsyn's junta ruled us cannot be forgiven. So take up, worker, the banner! Help the front!

Our system, until recent events, resembled a symbiosis of cooperation between workers and factories, where there were at least still good conditions for workers. But with Solzhenitsyn's arrival, this situation has been broken, and workers are on strike against such inhumane labor standards.\n\nIn the absence of guarantees for political and social stability, our economy cannot react in any way adequately. In an attempt to survive, businesses have stopped obeying decrees from the state and are stopping for lack of funding."

What he did did not bring any results or benefit to the economy of Berezniki, and perhaps he did it on purpose in order to justify the incorporation of Berezniki into Vyatka even more. Nevertheless, the fact is that there are no councils now, and the workers are defenseless at the moment. \n\nEven though we can return everything to the way it was before Kazem-Bek's death, we have an opportunity to tweak the work of the councils. We'll take as a model the system that was still in the Soviet Union, and that's why we'll take it from there."

It was opened back in Soviet times, namely in 1933, but it did not get a strong development in the USSR, nor in Berezniki. However, everyone knew that in the future, this factory would develop rapidly, because of the importance of titanium in the world, although now it is not used anywhere in Russia. It is only sold to middlemen.\n\nIn this plant there were hellish working conditions, but it was compensated by good wages, as well as the influence of the workers on the plant. However, after Solzhenitsyn's coup, the "workers' rights" were quickly removed: they destroyed the councils, reduced wages, removed the boss elected by the workers for some unknown person, and also increased the working day. Clearly, Solzhenitsyn's government stupidly transported all the titanium to Vyatka, so that already the Tsar and his entourage were earning their keep.\n\n\n\nThe working day began, and Andrei no longer had any enthusiasm to do anything. However, he couldn't find anyone at work, everyone was gathered in one circle. They were discussing something. And Andrei only walked up to them.\n\n\n\n- Andrei, we've been waiting for you! The councils have been returned to the working people! We're electing a new chief! - At least something good came out of these days," Andrei said, smiling.It didn't take long for the councils to get elected. They chose Andrei as the new head of the plant. Andrey was glad that Berezniki went the right way. But there was no time to relax!

Their reluctance and dissatisfaction is justified, but they do not understand that we will not go down this road now. \n\n\n\nVladimir Gil needs to address the army, which is fighting Vyatka right now.

It was felt that the Russian sons were not fighting against each other while the Germans were destroying the Russians in Muscovy. But it was only one moment. And that moment had passed.\n\nGil climbed the wooden podium the soldiers had just created. The soldiers looked menacingly at their leader. They were all already exhausted. They had already been promised a lot: first the Soviet Union, then Vyatka with his traitorous White Guards, then Kazem-Bek with his "people's" monarchism. And now Gil stood before them with his idea of a people's republic headed by a people's leader. For too long they have been told lies on their ears. Is there a ray of hope for Russia, or is it just the same as before? Gil began his speech: Soldiers! You've been confused for a long time. Confused about ideology, confused about country, confused about leaders. I can help you untangle this thread. The White Guards and their false czar Vladimir want to take control of Russia. Vladimir betrayed his country during the West Russian War, when he took the German side. How can we trust this man after that? Look at what his dog Solzhenitsyn did when he came to power! He wanted to drown us in blood, but we won. However, we only won the battle, not the war. You can argue to me that I am only a dictator. That I use "peoplehood" as my weapon. But even so, tell me: will you serve traitors? Will you serve those who destroyed our country to shreds? The soldiers sharply said, "No! All of them were ready to fight this snake. All of them were ready to destroy monarchism, and they were ready to go along with the new leader, Vladimir Gil.\n\n\n\n- We will never go after the Tsars again. No Tsar will now be an authority for us, no matter how gracious or powerful he may call himself. We will henceforth take an entirely different, third road. Neither Czarism nor Bolshevism."

We do not have Moscow behind us, but even here we cannot retreat - Berezniki is behind us! We must not retreat even a step back and not give a single inch of our land to the White Guard.

He fought bravely at the front and tried to cheer us up before the fight. We all knew he was a "hit man. He was a so-called agitator to educate us ideologically.

Even very hard defeats, that's for sure. But even though our training and equipment are bad, we have something these whites don't have: unity! We are all fighting for Russia. For a Russia without exploitation. For a Russia where everyone will be equal, where the state will be a people's state. For the sake of our wives and our mothers, we shall march forward zealously and not retreat! After all, if not us, who will build the Russia of the Future? Those czars who drink our blood? They will never see such a future! We, like Danko from Gorky's book, will tear out our hearts so that others may live happily. But we have no land behind us, so be it! It's better to die free than to live under the oppression of czars! I raise this toast to our dead for a better future, and may there be fewer victims tomorrow. - Nikita finished his speech by drinking his vodka. The soldiers exclaimed too.

However, such a good trend has suddenly led to a new problem, which was hard to expect under the current circumstances. \n\nThe patriotism of our people has affected not only the combat-ready citizens, but also those who cannot hold a rifle or those who are not physically suited to us. The sacrifice of our people knows no limits, and sometimes even half-blind and systematically undernourished soldiers lose consciousness right on the battlefield. It is better to send such people home, leaving only the most capable at the front. Those who are weak physically will have to be sent for additional training."

According to his own observations, it was impossible to say that the front was calm, on the contrary - there were intense battles not for life, but to the death. He had to keep his hand on the pulse of the battle to coordinate the action, and he had a walkie-talkie nearby. \n\nThe radio operator's report on the wire was not reassuring - troops were dying like flies. Many of them simply didn't know how to fight, and some weren't even physically fit. It became immediately clear that even the measures introduced until recently were insufficient and did not address this part of the issue. \n\nYuri Voronkov had to go to the front. When he arrived, he went out to the soldiers who looked very tired or wounded. He talked to one of them: - Comrade Private, what is your name? - Vasily, Comrade Commander. - Don't you know my rank? - The colonel, instead of becoming enraged by this, did not vent his anger and said it with a calm intonation, though he was annoyed by the obvious unpreparedness of the soldiers. - I am a colonel, and to address me as "Comrade Colonel. How long have you been here? - One month, Comrade Colonel. - Listen to my command. You're transferring to the reserves. You're too weak and don't know much, and I'm sorry to inform you, but you're not in your place. - Comrade Colonel, why? - Said Vasily with an intonation of some disappointment. - You don't have the strength, and it's even obvious. Who looked so shabby at the enlistment office that they let you in? If you're so eager to serve the cause of our country, then go to the reserves and train there. - What about the others? I'm not the only one. - Then you'll all be replaced by a new unit that will take your place, and you go to training camp, where we'll determine exactly where you'll go.

Solzhenitsyn and his associates were to be tried for treason, although the main characters of the skit were surrounded by the media from the very beginning, but they were not allowed to give any comments until the end of the process, apparently, to avoid predicting the outcome based on what the characters said.\n\nIn the normal rules of public and civilized trial, the prosecution spoke first.\n\nYour Honor, the prosecution seeks to punish the main defendant under Articles 71 paragraph two, 143, 87 paragraph one, 13 paragraph two for abuse of power, gangsterism, violation of citizen's rights, intentional infliction of physical harm to people who do not please him.

These two ideologies, two dogmas and two opposites lead nowhere. Bukharin's Soviet Union and the Tsarist Russian Empire perished because they proved ineffective in the face of the challenges of the times, and in addition were themselves flawed in most of their dogmas. The Russian Empire, led by the pseudo-Russian Tsar Nicholas II, did terrible damage to the Russian nation, completely ignoring the hardships and privations which had accumulated over the centuries of our history. It itself, however, was not strong enough to defend its own power and its own people against the revolutionary elements of the Judeo-Bolshevik faction led by Lenin. Bukharin's USSR, with its extreme internationalism and even cosmopolitanism, made the Russian nation rotten to the point that it was unable to pull itself together and fight back against the Nazi threat. \n\nWe are not advocates of degenerate liberalism and anti-human Nazism. The liberalism of the Western world has proven to be extremely degenerate, because the beautiful ideas of equality for all conceal the emptiness and soullessness of the human race. Without a moral solid core, they were destroyed by the German machine, the same spiritual inhuman machine, which milled so many people that it began to overreact itself and thus found itself in the deepest crisis, showing all its inefficiency before history.\n\nThe Russian way - to keep up with the times and become fascist - to combine real, Russian socialism with the preservation of the Russian identity. Our own way of the Mladorossians, as was originally correctly set forth at the beginning of the path, is through fascism. We must unite our entire nation with one single strong leader, and we will have to do this under a single flag that will make our people strong spiritually and physically. Our people will no longer suffer from those in power who represent the interests of the minority. Our leader, Vladimir Gil, will now represent the interests of the majority, all of our people.

Vladimir no longer had any illusions at all about what would be done to him and possibly to his own family. However, he was no longer worried about himself, but only about his family - his daughter Maria, his wife Leonida Georgievna, and, in general, all the people close to him.\n\nUn After he was dragged to the place of execution, he was ordered to stand near the wall. As he walked to the wall he saw several more of his associates. Some were sorry that it had happened this way, some even wept in front of the former King himself that it had happened this way. But most were certain that this was not the end of the fight.\n\n\n\n- Forgive me, my King... - Said one of his subordinates, clearly weeping.\n\n\n\n- Silence! - Suddenly interrupted by the officer's rough, slightly hoarse voice. - Listen to my command! Vladimir and the others looked in the direction of the officer and the soldiers, who were standing there with automatic rifles. The former Tsar saw among all these soldiers a couple of those who had the uniform of the Vyatka principality. Seeing this, he was annoyed that some of the soldiers of his imperial army had gone over to the side of Gil, the new Mladorosses. As it turned out, not everyone was so loyal to the Tsar. Now what? Where is this king? He stands right in front of them, but he means nothing to them anymore.\n\nIn the name of the state of Berezniki - the officer began to read out loud and clear - and by the order of Vladimir Gil himself I order:- First, in respect of Vladimir III Kirillovich Romanov, Tsar of Vyatka, representative of the Romanov Imperial House, to carry out the highest punishment - execution for betraying the Russian people and murder of our leader Alexander Sergeyevich Kazem-Bek!\n\nSecond, in relation to the former government of the Duchy of Vyatka, for aiding and abetting the Nazi occupiers and supporting treason against the Russian people, to carry out the highest punishment, the firing squad! \n\nThird, in relation to the family of Vladimir III Kirillovich Romanov, to put under house arrest with the possibility of their redemption. In the name of all Russian people the Romanovs will never, ever again, encroach upon the authority of our people. Two seconds later the command was given: "Fire!

Tomorrow there will be an assault, and you all had better get a good sleep, if you don't want to die here. Meanwhile, there was a sudden creaking sound in one of the houses where Nikiforov was stationed. A well-disguised door opened in the floor, leading into the cellar.

Tell me they've already stripped us to the bone! - Don't worry, he seems unarmed. If he really is an Aryan, one fraction less an Aryan.\n\n\n\nIn that moment Nikiforov realized that he found himself in a hopeless situation. Even if he said that he was Russian, it would not clear him of suspicion; after all, "Aryans" are also Russians. Any appeal to rank would not help the man in the nightgown either. Finally he made up his mind and said: - My name is Igor Nikiforov and I command a division of the Berezniki People's Army and we have come to free you. - Indeed.

Comrade Krotov and Private Zelenkin, who was carrying a crooked parody of a swastika, emerged from there.Comrade Krotov, can you explain to me why the hell...you brought that here?!\n\nComrade Colonel, it's as clear as daylight, it's the sign of the Judeo-Nazis who sold out our homeland, so we'll take it and melt it down, so to speak, for the good of the country..." The Colonel said after a while..."

MAR_GILc_Strategic_space_desc: "By cleansing all our newly acquired territories of monarchists, pseudo-Aryans, and joining the Orthodox warriors, we were thus able to secure Berezniki from total destruction. We were able to withstand such a dark hour that now we have become a force to be reckoned with by all other aspirants to unite all of Western Russia under their flag.\n\non-obviously, we need to move on. We must not stop at one place, and we must continue to fight for a great Russia. And before we act in any way, we need to understand how our opponents will act next."
MAR_Gil.21.t: "Chess Game"
MAR_Gil.21.d: "Vladimir Gil was pleased that his people were able to secure at least some of Berezniki. This little state has grown in area several times over, and now no one laughs in our direction when we talk about the greatness of Russia. Our enemies used to laugh when they saw our small country, one of dozens of small fragments of the once great Russia. But now they have fallen silent, the skeptics are now convinced of something else - that we are capable of more, and we have indeed justified the title of the "dark horse" of Western Russia.\n\n\n\nUnWe have made our move, and now we have to figure out what to do next. The best thing we can do now is to analyze the future actions of our enemies. They say that the only way to read our opponent's mind is to play chess with him, and the battle for Western Russia can be called like a chess game.\n\nIn the north, it's obvious that if we look to the north, there will be a Western Russian Revolutionary Front, which will obviously seek to revive this very front in the boundaries of the 50s. The only way for them to do that is to the south, and that is why they pose a serious danger to us.{nIn the meantime, in the south is Samara, with the most vile and most hated collaborators in Russia, the KONR. They are now distracted to take over all the neighbors around them. Gorky, Bashkiria, Tatarstan are their first targets, and while they are trying to capture them, we will have time to deal with the enemy in the north.\n\n\n\non-obviously, the greatest danger to us is the FDRF, and so we must first of all pay attention to them and crush them as quickly as possible. We must not delay, and we will have to get to them as soon as possible, overcoming the extremely unstable Komi and seizing neutral Vologda for more comfortable positions."

MAR_GILc_Catastrotphe_of_the_democracy_desc: "The Komi Republic was one of the democracies that was formed after the fall of the VRA. We all know that democracy is just a degenerate Western idea that destroys the spirit and morality of a healthy person. Moreover, communists trickle in there as well, who are like us in some points, but no more than that. We will not make any concessions and we will destroy this misunderstanding with an iron roll."

MAR_GILc_ashes_to_ashes_desc: "The Komi are under our power ... but are the people under our power? They are protesting and demanding the return of the old regime. They call us "fascists," which of course is a lie. But the people must be reassured. If they cannot accept the truth, which it is, they must be frightened. We will conduct demonstration purges of everyone who gets in our way. Everyone will be afraid of us. Everyone will understand our power."

MAR_GILc_simmilar_ideas_simmilar_goals_desc: "The degenerate liberal republic of Komi was destroyed not by external enemies, but by heroes who dared to take over the situation. Right-wing forces in Komi were able to do this. What any adequately thinking people should have done - they overthrew liberal democracy and took the power in their own hands - was done. Now there are really capable people in power in Komi, who can pull the country out of the ruins.Of course, the right-wing forces in Komi are as heterogeneous as the political situation in the country as a whole until recently. However, the right-wing forces, now in Ust-Sysolk, have much in common with our ideals. They also dream of reviving the great Russia and making it people-oriented, with a bias toward national specifics. Shafarevich and his national reformism and Serov and his Ordos socialism are close enough to us in spirit, and if they are persuaded to join us, they will join Berezniki and help us further revive Russia. They will be able to occupy important enough government positions, so they have little to lose from that.\n\nIn the end, why spill Russian blood unnecessarily when we have similar ideas?"

MAR_GILc_In_hard_times_desc: "No matter how we may now feel about the Reds, they tried to liberate the Motherland in the West Russian War. It is worth admitting that this attempt could have turned out to be a victory for the Russian people, but they failed to do so, and the blame for this is the numerous betrayals in the rear of the ZRRF in the darkest hour for our homeland. Among these traitors was General Vasily Ivanov, who took a no man's land with the Germans or the Reds.\n\n\n\nThe army of Ivanov could have done something more useful for the perishing Motherland than what they actually did. They got right in our way to unify Western Russia, and they are in a convenient position to attack right at Arkhangelsk, which is why we need them so badly. Nevertheless, if they are no longer willing to shed any more Russian blood, before we annex them, we will have to put them before a simple choice - to join the rebirth of our state, or to die as a real army, which should have done its duty sooner or later."

MAR_GILc_You_cant_walk_under_white_flag_desc: "Becoming a neutral state is akin to throwing out the white flag on the battlefield. In essence, what happened to Ivanov's army and the like is the surrender without a fight of the territories of our Motherland to the enemy, even if this enemy is not on this very territory.\n\nIn such difficult times, Russia needs a high morale, but the fact that there are defeatists, pacifists, and supporters of neutrality in our ranks - it all just spoils the overall picture of what is happening."

However, we all saw the effectiveness of the USSR during the Great Patriotic War, the consequences of which we will have to deal with in the future. The communists themselves are weak: they destroyed the economy, the army, and did not properly prepare Russia for this terrible war. That is why they now speak of us only with derision, not fear.

It is true that there were problems in relation to the workers and that the degenerate ideas of capitalism were destroying the Russian man - this is a fact. We had already given impetus to the development of the Soviets, which the Bolsheviks had groomed in every possible way. However, now the state has become truly social, mladorussian. We do not need the Bolsheviks to put their sticks in the work of the Soviets. The problem is solved, and the workers go side by side with the state!"

Many generals would go under, except ... some friends. Tukhachevsky was Gil's comrade-in-arms during the Western Russian War.

MAR_GILc_German_lapdogs_desc: "If there are even more nastier traitors to the homeland than Vladimir III, then unequivocally for any Russian person it would be Andrei Vlasov and his gang from the KONR. Such a treacherous betrayal cannot be justified in any way, for they are cursed by many Russian families whose sons died at the hands of this gang. Nevertheless, they remained almost the only real force that could somehow confront us in the south and thus claim to rule the whole of free Western Russia.Certainly, if you try to understand their goals, namely the creation of a Russian national state, in some ways they are similar to us. We are also trying to revive the Russian nation, as well as perhaps other forces in this region. But to be friends with them, let alone to consider them similar to us, is the same as to renounce one's own faith. They will not consider us friends, or even speak to us as 'comrade.'"

MAR_GILc_This_for_War: "Atonement by Blood"
MAR_GILc_This_for_War_desc: "After we crushed the KONR in Samara and captured Vlasov himself and his gang, we can safely say that the most vile traitors to the Motherland got what they deserved. We only have to integrate Samara and its surroundings into our country, to take one more step toward the unification of Western Russia, which, in fact, is already over.{n\n\nThe people now do not consider us traitors, at least even the smallest doubts have been eliminated. Nevertheless, the people demand maximum punishment for Vlasov and his gang for betraying Russia in its darkest hour, and for that we shall be forced to make a people's trial. Obviously, there is nothing that can justify them in this situation, and therefore they should be killed, as should Vladimir III and his henchmen. For those who have not particularly distinguished themselves in the CONR, we will be able to give them a second chance to redeem themselves with blood."

And all these centuries they enjoyed the many benefits that our people provided them, received our protection but betrayed Russia by declaring its independence in its darkest hour. And now many Russian families, who have long lived in these lands, are under their oppression, as if in the days of the Horde yoke. But like Tsar Ivan IV, we will send our troops to capture Ufa and Kazan to punish the self-proclaimed nations for their treachery and free our countrymen!"

MAR_GILc_first_drafts: "First drafts"
MAR_GILc_first_drafts_desc: "Of course, our state has a vast body of laws for its size, but so far they have not represented a whole, remaining a collection of incoherent and sometimes contradictory instructions of the country's leaders and such an approach made sense when we have not yet begun our expansion, but now Berezniki is closer to that critical point where the chaotic legislation of our country will finally stop functioning, risking dragging everything else down with it. We should immediately address the constitution-making process, and especially the national question, because the status of our conquered Tatars and Bashkirs remains unclear, which also hampers the efficient management of the country.\n\nIn addition, by placing a strong emphasis on the sense of Russian identity, for the first time in many years we can truly unite the nation, which at first found no way out in the prison of the Tsarist regime, then was divided by the Soviet international propaganda, only to be finally brought down by the second war with Germany, which brought the nationalists to its final ruin. But, thanks to our efforts and victories, it will be revived."

MAR_GILc_Pact_with_Bandits_desc: "The Gorky Plant remains one of the few industrialized regions of Western Russia that has not yet fallen into Nazi hands. Its potential is very serious, and its plants, designed to produce tanks and other equipment, could serve the common cause for the benefit of Russia. However, if we want to get our hands on this tank factory, we'd better try not to destroy what's left of the legacy of the Bukhara USSR.So before we even dare to launch an attack on Gorki and its very solid tank force, we will offer them to become part of our state. They will be able to agree to it at least because our forces will be more than they can counter us, and therefore the process will take little time. If they refuse, we will have to engage the enemy's tank forces."

MAR_GILc_Deal_with_tankguys_desc: "Bitter is under our control, as are the remnants of the 'bandit' tanks. Many ex-soldiers are attracted to the very ideology of Mladorossism, but they want to offer a "compromise" - they stay in service and get promotions in the form of privileges as well as salaries, while we get professional tankmen who can turn the tide of war and be the prototype for the future Russian army. \n\nOf course, their privileges will cost the treasury a pretty penny, but the benefit we get in the form of professional tankers is greater than that. After all, tanks can easily turn the tide of any battle, and therefore any war. And so this initiative must go smoothly and cleanly."

MAR_GILc_deal_with_cancer: "Cure Cancer"
MAR_GILc_deal_with_cancer_desc: "Even though our "manifesto of the nation" is an attempt to explain the essence of our ideology, nevertheless, the fact remains that the true meaning of our idea is understood by perhaps only two people in the country, namely Gil himself and Wilczkowski. Everyone else interprets the manifesto differently, thus distorting the true essence of Young Socialism. This generates revisionism and in general destabilizes the situation in the country, and in addition, it generates misunderstanding of our policy among the population.\n\nIn fact, it is possible to admit that our ideology turned out, to be frank, neither fish nor meat. The hastily made idea to give at least some beacon of hope to our citizens in Berezniki, now we need to finish it and smooth out the rough edges. Only in this way can we get rid of any misunderstanding and revisionism among our ideology, and thus we can unite the Russian people, who until recently have been divided by the boundaries of pseudo-leaders."
