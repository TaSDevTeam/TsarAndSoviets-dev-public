Despite the complete absence of public politics, soldiers and officers are not interested in the economic aspect of the controlled territories, and the commander of the military district tries to maintain informal ties with clergy, former leaders of partisan movements, and politicians who did not tarnish themselves with cooperation with the Reich.\n\nFormed, largely based on the experience of OFN military mandates and Japanese imperial garrisons, the military districts are seen as a temporary measure on the path to 'stabilizing the political climate and cleansing society of all fascist and other radical elements.'

 MAR_2WRW.1978.d:0 "The Kremlin and the Tsar's palace were empty. The Tsar was neither in Moscow nor in Vyatka. Only a few knew that on that sunny day he visited his old dacha near Berezniki. On the porch stood not the Tsar-General, but a simple man, Seryoga Belozersky, who was gathering fishing rods and tackle. Wanting to spend at least one day peacefully resting in nature, he visited the lakes where he had been before, back in the days of the rift between Vyatka and Berezniki. Little had changed in these forests since then, except that the hum of German bombers had disappeared. Sergei put on rubber boots, waded deeper into the water, and began to fish. He forgot about his worries and simply enjoyed the silence and beauty of nature. After filling a bucket with fish, it became clear that it was starting to get dark. Sergei got out of the water and sat on the shore of the lake. The sunset in the forest over the water looked magnificent. Sergei was thinking about his own concerns. About how everything could have turned out differently. About how all the people of his kingdom can now also peacefully watch the sunset. About how much he had managed to accomplish and how much more he would achieve. The sun finally disappeared below the horizon, and Sergei decided to wrap things up. He began to rise and...\n\n...he couldn't. Half of his body went numb, and he fell on his side. Any attempts to shout and call for help were futile; only a hoarse whisper came out. Help came immediately from the MGB employees guarding the forest where the Tsar was.\n\nTwo hours later, Sergei was flown by helicopter to the central Ural hospital in Yekaterinburg. Five hours later, Kazem-Bek and Kosygin arrived at the hospital. By noon, despite all the help provided by the doctors, it became clear that Sergei Belozersky had passed away."

For several days, every possible detail that could raise doubts on either side was discussed. Disputes arose over any issue; however, through lengthy negotiations, Finland was able to make a final decision, marking a positive outcome for the attempt to return Karelia. Finland committed to withdrawing troops from all necessary territories and transferring the lands to Russia.\n\nThis historic event was made possible by the persistence and tenacity of our delegation, which conducted negotiations at the highest levels. The escalation of discussions sometimes led to heated arguments, but both sides understood the importance and sensitivity of the issue. Karelia holds great significance for both Russia and Finland, and for many years this question remained a subject of debate and disagreement.

A quick occupation of key cities in the Scandinavian state promised not only to force the Finnish government to capitulate but also to establish a friendly regime that would renounce previous claims and engage in full cooperation with Russia, without looking back at past conflicts.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, our country is tired of constant wars.

Participants meticulously worked through every figure and condition, noting possible changes in case of unforeseen circumstances. While Russia sought to minimize all possible financial losses, Turkey, on the contrary, tried to inflate the price for the land it was already willing to give up. This created tension in the negotiations and sometimes led to heated debates and even mild conflicts of opinion.\n\nBoth sides realized that the speed of agreement depended not only on the financial aspect but also on the geopolitical stability of the region. After several days of intensive discussions, representatives from both sides came to a consensus on the need for compromise to achieve long-term success. Thus, they reached a final decision that satisfied the interests of both countries.\n\nWhen the deal was officially formalized, there was nothing left but to celebrate such a success.

Such rejection of compromise by the authorities led to additional questions about the future of relations between the two countries.\n\nThis failure caused dissatisfaction among many high-ranking officials who expected a more significant and constructive outcome. They emphasized the need for flexibility in strategy in the face of existing threats.\n\nHowever, Russia's interests remained steadfast; surrendering without a fight was unacceptable. The idea arose to take forceful action, up to the forcible capture of the city, putting Turkey before a choice between escalating the conflict and accepting defeat. Russia was preparing for decisive steps against its opponent to demonstrate strength in the region.\n\nNevertheless, the awareness of the consequences of such an initiative was obvious: such actions could lead to a more destructive war with accompanying economic losses and human casualties. This would inevitably affect Russia's national image.\n\nThe most significant risk was the complete loss of nascent relations between the states, up to the severance of diplomatic ties with Turkey due to aggressive actions.\n\nA new dilemma arose before the Empire and the Tsar: to act by force or to strive for peaceful cooperation.

Turkish forces were caught off guard and unable to offer proper resistance; soon they had to begin retreating from their positions. Those few garrisons that dared to engage in battle were utterly defeated.\n\nAfter successfully occupying all necessary territories, Russian troops halted without advancing further. This decision was a strategically calculated step: based on the successes achieved, the command understood that further aggression was pointless — the goals set for the military were accomplished. Now, the important task remained to consolidate the positions gained and establish control over the recently occupied territory. The significance of this achievement lay not only in military victory but also in the opportunity to demonstrate Russia's strength on the international stage.\n\nMeanwhile, actions from Turkey were awaited with undisguised interest: how would it respond to such sharp actions taken by the Russian side?

Quickly seizing the initiative, the Turkish army forced Russian formations to suffer defeats; soldiers attempting to show bravery encountered only stubborn resistance.\n\nIn the end, the operation concluded without any territorial changes and only with losses of dozens of lives. The failed adventure became a reminder of unjustified risk. It became evident that further actions would no longer bring significant results; declaring war would only exacerbate internal tension and lead to mass protests among the population, who were outraged by such a political decision.\n\nSuch a failure had a profound impact on the international position of the Russian Empire. Relations with Turkey were completely destroyed and required long restoration; the Batumi defeat became a symbol of failure in the minds of ordinary people and acquired a nominal meaning in communication, and the reputation of the Russian army fell significantly."

Intelligence reported newly formed battalions and a preliminary assessment of several tens to hundreds of thousands of soldiers sent to occupy positions and prepare for possible actions.\n\nThe most heated discussions erupted over how to proceed in this situation. Among all proposals, three possible options took precedence:\n\nThe first option was to retreat. It was evident that the attempt to reclaim the region had turned into too serious consequences. Continuing to argue with Turkey could lead to a new war, the consequences of which, regardless of the outcome, would bring numerous problems.\n\nThe second option was to choose a waiting tactic. One cannot lose what has been achieved, but excessive aggression could provoke a severe conflict. It was proposed to prepare defenses: one cannot show weakness at such an important moment.\n\nThe last proposal was to immediately start a war with Turkey. Russian troops have sufficient experience to deliver a strong blow to the positions of the potential enemy. War could finally resolve the age-old confrontation between the two states.

The decisive role was no longer played by rifles and their owners, but by diplomats who were urgently preparing the basis for restoring torn relations after several mutual aggressive responses to each other. The formation of conditions under which a final peace could be formalized began.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the command agreed with such an initiative. Many generals, considering final success inevitable, advocated for stopping the peace initiative while there was still a chance. Instead of signing a new status quo, it would be worth occupying new territories that Russia had been pursuing since past centuries. Perhaps this was the last chance to realize a great dream.\n\nTrue, prolonging the conflict was unlikely to lead to exclusively positive results. But the desire for greater opportunities at the end of the war did not give peace. The Crown approved its final decision on this issue."

Long-lost lands could once again become part of Russia; but the current owners, obviously, were not going to part with what had belonged to them for a long time without a fight.\n\nDespite all the efforts of Russian diplomats to convince Bucharest to accept the proposal soberly and judiciously, the Romanian side remained adamant. By rejecting Russia's ultimatum, it fully understood the possible consequences.\n\nDisappointed with this outcome, the diplomatic corps returned to the Homeland with discouraging news.

Diplomats from both countries actively worked to deepen ties, emphasizing not only territorial acquisitions but also creating conditions for joint prosperity in a unified space of cooperation.\n\nThus, Poland and Russia moved to a new stage of their historical interaction—partnership based on trust, mutual support, and respect for each other."

However, a sober analysis of the political situation forced the Iranian authorities to reconsider their attitude. Internal problems and uncertainty at the international level underscored that an open conflict with Russia could lead to catastrophic consequences.\n\nAfter carefully weighing all circumstances, Tehran decided to transfer Dahistan. This was a compromise that allowed avoiding military action and maintaining stability in the region. Negotiations between Russian representatives and Iran led to the conclusion of an agreement.\n\nDahistan became an integral part of the Russian Empire, opening a new chapter in the history of regional politics. Russia promptly engaged in the process of integrating the new territories: large-scale investments were directed towards the development of Dahistan's infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, the transfer of Dahistan became a significant success for Russian foreign policy. This event laid the foundation for further strengthening Russia's positions in the region and expanding its spheres of influence on the international stage."

The main goal of this expedition was a rescue operation—to extract the destitute German troops after dramatic events that left them in despair at the edge of the world.\n\nFinally, the ships broke through the icy desert and docked at the frozen shore; Russian troops stepped onto the snowy expanses of Antarctica, heading towards the ruins of the former German base. Inside the destroyed structures of the Reich, a thorough search for survivors began—exhausted and weakened Germans whose resistance was broken by hunger and cold.\n\nThe abandoned garrison, intended for scientific exploration and defense of a strategic zone, faced betrayal by their own commanders. Scarce resources combined with the harshness of Antarctic nature forced the Germans to reconsider their beliefs; the flags of the Third Reich had long ceased to flutter in the wind—faith in help from the metropolis faded, becoming a naive illusion.\n\nThe evacuation became a severe test: a long journey through icy barriers and the need to provide humanitarian assistance to the rescued personnel. Despite all the difficulties, the operation ended in victory—the German personnel were successfully evacuated, and the most valuable scientific achievements and technologies passed into Russian hands as trophies of heroism and strategic foresight."

The military method of establishing influence may be disadvantageous: in the event of direct invasion, there is a threat that the new state will receive independence guarantees from the Greater German Reich and join the Unity Pact, which would mean premature confrontation with Germany simultaneously with the conflict in Central Asia.\n\nIn this regard, to avoid increasing tension with the Unity Pact, I recommend abandoning any attempts to invade the territory of the former Central Asian republics until the Reich's influence wanes, while creating a separate line of fortifications to protect our southern border from the infiltration of Turkic nationalists.\n\nCommander of the Central Asian Military District - General of the Army Rutskoy A.V."

The territories of former Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are zones of absolute power vacuum, while the East is held more de jure than de facto by theocratic and fundamentalist regimes. The only enclave of real power is in the southern part, occupied by the Turkestan Legion.\n\nJapan aimed to prevent the expansion of Reich and US influence, and as a result, Central Asia is now a zone of free expansion. A limited military contingent is capable of quickly taking control of the entire territory, although restoring state institutions and integrating them into Russia will take time. For this reason, and considering that if we do not take Central Asia under control, Afghanistan and Iran will, I recommend starting a military operation at the first convenient opportunity to include the region as an autonomy.\n\nDetails on the logistical and technical aspects necessary for the successful operation in the territories of the former Central Asian republics will be provided in a separate report.\n\nCommander of the Central Asian Military District - General of the Army Rutskoy A.V."

Central Asia is now squeezed between us, Afghanistan, and Iran, and the government of the Turkmen Republic realizes the possibility of imminent war where they have no allies. Economically, it is under blockade, unable to trade without transit through hostile Afghanistan or Iran. For these reasons, the ruling circles should be open to dialogue on military and economic cooperation with Russia, even if it may mean becoming our subject.\n\nAt the same time, I want to emphasize that in case of negotiation failure, it may be more advantageous for us to recognize the sovereignty of the new republic. At this stage, they cannot pose a danger to us, but in the event of our direct invasion, due to their favorable relations with the United States of America, we may suffer significant diplomatic losses.\n\nHead of the MID Department for the Central Asian Region - Mikhailov S.G."

In response, supporters of the new regime took to the streets, leading to uprisings in multiple cities and marking the beginning of a civil war.

The former are more inclined towards nationalism and do not hide their reluctance to cooperate with our country in most cases. On the other side are the Islamist democrats, who, despite being open to external communication, are anti-communists, and given the specifics of our state... I'm afraid they will quickly forget their gratitude for any assistance.\n\n– Neither is better than the other... We cannot simply observe Afghanistan silently if we wish to extend our influence into Central Asia, but we cannot support either side. What then should we do? – mused Alexei II, continuing his pacing.\n\n– I can suggest another option, – said Gil, deciding to voice his opinion on the dilemma. – Instead of choosing whom to support, we should directly intervene in the conflict. That way, we can establish a government loyal to us.\n\nHearing Gil's proposal, Alexei paused for a moment to consider.

 MAR_Japan.9.t:0 "Call from Harbin"
 MAR_Japan.9.d:0 "Gil leaned over the military plans of Primorye scattered on the table, deep in thought. He needed to mark the new positions of the Russian People’s Tsardom troops in the new territories, but suddenly a piercing ring sounded.\n\n'Hmm...' Gil’s gaze fell on the newest secure communication phone. It was the external intelligence of the MGB, and a call from them meant only one thing—urgent information.\n'Gil speaking,' he said as he picked up the receiver.\n'Vladimir Vladimirovich! Our asset from Harbin has urgently contacted us. He reports that Manchurian insurgents and Kim Il-sung’s partisans have started an open rebellion against the Japanese and their puppets. The government army has not yet managed to react, so if we send troops now to support the insurgents, we have a good chance to strike back at Japan and push the Sphere even further out of Manchuria,' reported the MGB officer on the other end.\n\nGil understood that this was very important information, and he immediately requested a full report. Then he abruptly hung up and, grabbing another phone, prepared to make another call."
 MAR_Japan.9.a:0 "Need to call the Tsar..."

 MAR_Japan.10.t:0 "Partisan Activity in the Far East"
 MAR_Japan.10.d:0 "In recent weeks, there have been numerous attacks on garrisons, derailed trains, fires, mysterious deaths, and disappearances of Kwantung Army officers in Outer Manchuria. There is no doubt that this is the work of the Russian underground. Against the backdrop of the recent reunification of Russia, the increasing partisan activity does not seem coincidental.\n\nToday, a representative of the Russian resistance arrived at the headquarters of the Far Eastern Military District in Blagoveshchensk. They are requesting our support in the upcoming uprising against the occupation authorities. We should not delay with a response; the Japanese have already begun to pull forces from the islands to suppress a possible uprising."
 MAR_Japan.10.a:0 "For now, we will observe."

 MAR_Japan.11.t:0 "Partisan Activity in the Far East"
 MAR_Japan.11.d:0 "To General Gil.\n\nIn the territories occupied by the forces of the Japanese Empire in Khabarovsk Krai, Amur Oblast, and Primorsky Krai, there is a sharp increase in partisan activity.\n\nIntelligence reports daily combat clashes between garrisons and partisans, accompanied by high casualties on both sides. The battle near the village of Desna deserves special mention: competent command actions allowed the partisans to destroy a light weapons depot and the Kwantung Army garrison guarding it without suffering losses.\n\nThe partisan forces mainly consist of the Russian-speaking population of the territories controlled by Manchuria, and there is also a significant number of fighters from the Korean population. Our intelligence suggests that there is a similar organization in Korea resisting Japan, but we have not been able to trace it.\n\nThe partisans operate centrally, have a command chain modeled after the Soviet one, but also have separate autonomous cells deep in the enemy’s rear. The presumed leader of the Far Eastern cell is Captain Sergei Zaikin.\n\nInventive actions by the high command and high morale of the partisans have allowed them to launch a grand operation in Manchuria, threatening the stability of the entire region controlled by Japan."

 MAR_Japan.14.t:0 "Battle for Khabarovsk"
 MAR_Japan.14.d:0 "Alexey Grishin, once an illustrator and today, by the will of fate, an official in the printing house of the tsardom, was completely absorbed in his work: a reform of banknotes was coming, and therefore the issuance of new bills. He had long been thinking about which city to approve for the image on the five-thousand-ruble bill, and to distract himself, he turned on the radio on his windowsill. From the transmitter, an animated voice reported:\n\n'Today, at 9 a.m., the last surrounded forces of the Japanese Imperial Army surrendered in Khabarovsk; the city was finally liberated by the troops of the 2nd Army Corps of the People’s Movement for the Liberation of the Far East. In honor of this event, 12 salvos from 124 guns will be fired, and Khabarovsk will be awarded the title of the city of the first salute.'\n\nAt that moment, Alexey made his final decision: the new bill would feature the liberated Russian city of Khabarovsk."
 MAR_Japan.14.a:0 "Victory of the Russian will."

 MAR_Japan.15.t:0 "Battle for Khabarovsk"
 MAR_Japan.15.d:0 "Captain Zaikin sat at a table in a carefully camouflaged field headquarters; in front of him lay a map of the area with front lines drawn in pencil, and to his right stood a stationary radio station. The captain had not slept for three days; accumulated fatigue was overwhelming him, but he continued his work. Under his command were more than a thousand soldiers, each one’s fate in Zaikin’s hands, and he was not going to waste them. The captain was intently thinking about further battle plans when his thoughts were interrupted by the crackle of the radio.\n\n'Base, come in, over! Amur 2-3, calling Base, over!'\n\nZaikin grabbed the radio. 'Base here, Amur 2-3, report, over.'\n\n'Base, this is a disaster, we are under heavy enemy fire, they’re tearing us apart, only about half the personnel left! Requesting permission to retreat for regrouping, over!'\n\nZaikin broke into a cold sweat. 'Roger, Amur 2-3, standby for further orders. Hold on, guys!' Zaikin changed the frequency on the station and took the radio again. 'Base, calling Star 1-1, report the situation, over.'\n\nA hoarse voice began to grate from the speaker: 'Star 1-1, reporting, we are suffering heavy losses, running out of ammunition, advancing is impossible, over.' 'Understood, standby for further orders.'\n\nThe captain closed his eyes; the battle for Khabarovsk was lost. But this is not the end; we lost the battle, but not the war; the real battle is still ahead. For now, we need to regroup for a new strike. Captain Sergei Zaikin took the radio...\n\n'All units, I give the order to retreat!'"
 MAR_Japan.15.a:0 "We will definitely return."

 MAR_Japan.16.t:0 "Return to the Native Harbor"
 MAR_Japan.16.d:0 "Not long ago, no one imagined that Primorsky Krai, under Japanese control, could ever return to Russia. After all, it was still too weak to engage in any military actions with one of the three superpowers. However, now the flag of the Russian People’s Empire flies over these territories.\n\nNaturally, the Russian leadership visited Primorsky Krai after its accession. First, Prime Minister Vladimir Gil visited. He visited Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Birobidzhan, and other cities. There, he talked with local residents and promised them comprehensive assistance from the government, especially in restoring the cities’ infrastructure.\n\nAfter some time, Tsar Alexei II decided to visit Primorye. He met not only with citizens but also with former partisans who had been provided with comprehensive support all this time. The Tsar thanked them for their heroic performance of duty. Later, they were awarded the Order of St. George, 1st class.\n\nAlso, upon Alexei Nikolaevich’s arrival in Vladivostok, the locals organized a real celebration. Everywhere there were inscriptions 'Warm greetings to Tsar Alexei from the residents of Vladivostok,' 'Glory to the liberator Tsar Alexei II,' and others. In the evening, Alexei Nikolaevich attended a banquet in his honor.\n\nWhen the guests began to disperse, one of the KGB operatives, who were to accompany him during his trip, approached Alexei II and handed him an important message from Vladimir Gil. The message stated that thanks to the success of the partisan struggle in Primorye, partisans in Reichskommissariat Moskowien began similar activities as in Primorye."
 MAR_Japan.16.a:0 "Soon, we will celebrate in Moscow."

 MAR_Japan.17.t:0 "Vladivostok, Home"
 MAR_Japan.17.d:0 "Today will be remembered by the residents of Vladivostok for a long time. Tsar-General Sergei Belozersky descended from his steamer and stepped onto the city’s embankment, and the crowd behind the barriers greeted him with enthusiastic cheers. However, there was no time to be distracted; the leaders of the partisan movement came to meet the Tsar. They were all dressed in old Soviet dress coats. The Tsar greeted each of them as if they were old friends and presented them with awards for liberating the Motherland from occupation. The oldest of the partisans, who was visibly over seventy, approached the Tsar and, removing his fur hat, said: 'Many of us have been waiting for this moment for almost thirty years. Tsar-General, allow me to present you with the keys to the city.' At that moment, it became clear that the historic moment had arrived—Vladivostok had returned under Russian rule.\n\nThe subsequent conference at the mayor’s office and the joint declaration on the reintegration of Primorye into the Russian People’s Tsardom became not only a formal act but also a symbol of long-awaited unity. After signing the declaration and a press conference with the partisan leaders, the Tsar-General decided to hold another important ceremony—the opening of the Far Eastern branch of the Mladorossy party.\n\nArriving at the location, the Tsar was met with loud applause from party members and local residents. He addressed the residents of Vladivostok, assuring them that Russia does not forget about the common people and will do everything to ensure them a decent life and prosperity. All those who once fled north can now reclaim their old property. Asian peoples forcibly resettled by Japan during their barbaric policies must immigrate back to the Sphere countries or assimilate and continue farming in this region.\n\nThe festive mood lingered in the city for a long time, and the streets were filled with people celebrating the region’s return to Russia. As he left the city, Belozersky received a report from the MGB that the news of Vladivostok’s return had provoked a chain of uprisings in the German-occupied lands of Moscow and the Caucasus."

There, he spoke with local residents and promised them comprehensive assistance from the government, especially in restoring the cities' infrastructure.\n\nSome time later, Tsar Alexei II decided to visit Primorye himself. He met not only with citizens but also with the negotiators. The Tsar thanked them for their heroic fulfillment of duty. Later, they were awarded the St. George’s Cross, First Class.\n\nAlso, upon Alexei Nikolaevich’s arrival in Vladivostok, the local residents organized a true celebration. Everywhere there were inscriptions like 'Warm greetings to Tsar Alexei from the residents of Vladivostok,' 'Glory to the liberator Tsar Alexei II,' and others.

But despite the pretense of a friendly atmosphere, everyone in the car knew that the squabbling would soon begin. On one side were the Minister of Economy of united Russia and representatives of one of the zaibatsu—Nissan. On the other were the industrial magnates of Manchuria. The former needed to convince the latter to invest their money in the Urals, while the latter needed to convince the former to pay them extra for it.\n\nThe industrialists of Manchuria are the greediest and most ruthless bastards the Sphere has to offer, but Maslennikov and the Nissan representatives were prepared to go to great lengths to get the Manchurians to invest in the Urals. The car stopped at the new Nissan plant, which they had relocated from Osaka.\n\nInspecting the high-tech machinery and gleaming equipment, Mr. Yamaguchi, the informal leader of the Manchurians, addressed Maslennikov.\n\n— 'Mr. Maslennikov, esteemed colleagues from Nissan, we see a beautiful picture, but we don’t see real results. What can you offer to interest us?'\n\nMaslennikov, as if anticipating this, smirked and suggested everyone move to the negotiation room. Once inside, the men saw charts of income and expenses, production growth rates, and more. Handing Yamaguchi the report for the past year, Maslennikov began to answer his question.\n\n— 'Gentlemen, as you can see, this plant is delivering stunning results. Beyond preferential tax conditions and near-complete legal immunity, Russia can offer you something you won’t find anywhere else.'\n\n— 'And what is that?'\n\nThe Nissan representative, seizing his moment, completed their plan with Maslennikov, delivering the final blow to the Manchurians.\n\n— 'People, Yamaguchi-san. You see, the level of education most Russians possess is beyond the grasp of the average Chinese worker.

Vladivostok remains theirs, and we have no intention of backing down until we reclaim the entire Primorsky Krai through negotiations.'\n\n— 'And you intend to ask for our help in these negotiations? We’re willing, but we’re interested in your involvement in future conflicts.'\n\nGil’s friendly tone shifted to distrust and caution.\n\n— 'What are you talking about?'\n\n— 'You know exactly what I mean—it’s obvious. Soon you’ll try to take back what the Germans stole. It’s a noble goal, but we too will face something similar eventually. The question is, will you support us in that?'\n\n— 'We’ll accept any support you can provide, but as for a potential conflict between Japan and China, we can’t make any commitments yet.

After the welcoming ceremony, Hirohito and Romanov headed to the Imperial Palace. Along the route of the motorcade, crowds of Japanese greeted their Emperor and the symbol of their nation’s strength, though some among them waved the flags of united Russia.\n\nFinally, arriving at the Imperial Palace, Hirohito, Alexei, and the Prime Minister shook hands and entered.

The Motherland may have made the gravest mistake by allowing the Reich's victories, but we alone managed to bring the Germans to the brink of defeat in the First West Russian War, bringing them down from the heavens for the first time and shattering their dreams of victories without a single defeat.

Many territories, once lost in a distant war, were to raise the flag of Russia again. Achieving this without war was impossible. The time had come to prepare a plan of vengeance against those who dared to raise the sword over millions of innocent people. Convening the military to develop a full strategy; beginning the transition of the economy to a war footing; militarization of society; preparing the civilian population for wartime conditions—all necessary measures would be taken to prepare Russia for its final battle against the Nazi scum."

Preparing the speech became a key moment in the government's strategy. While mobilization plans were discussed behind closed doors, orators were preparing for radio and television.\n\nPapers with speeches already lay on the podium; all cameras were pointed at one spot, numerous microphones were ready for recording and broadcasting. Russians gathered in crowds near screens and radios in anticipation of the historic moment—everyone expected a momentous speech. They listened intently: every sound, every frame could be decisive. Everyone clearly understood—this speech was meant to ignite the flame in people’s hearts and point the way to the coming war. The agonizing wait came to an end when across the country it was announced: 'Address to the Russian people.'"

Now, united under one banner, the state was turning into a true force, ready to wipe any affliction from the face of the earth. Deep underwater or high in the skies—it didn’t matter, for the people, awakened after a severe illness, were ready to accept new postulates never seen before. However, achieving this would be impossible without that very war, which was to bring either human suffering or salvation to all the enslaved. In a disrupted world where everyone sought solace and hope, the Russian state, striving for recovery, became a beacon for those yearning for freedom in Eastern Europe. United, the people regained confidence in their strength, awakening the spirit of resistance. The new force required not just readiness for battle but also a shared vision of a future filled with peace and justice. Russia had to show the world that it could stand against the enemy at its borders."

In such circumstances, any weakness can become a threat to the operation’s success. Everyone faced a difficult test—minimizing losses among the population in the upcoming clashes. Fully aware that the Greater German Reich does not care about losses and is capable of using any means, including weapons of mass destruction, the military leadership proposed the initiative to build chains of bunkers in many settlements to protect the population from constant Luftwaffe attacks. No less important was the task of conducting large-scale drills among the civilian population on actions during air raids, evacuation, and moving to protected points."

At the same time, new means of warfare are emerging, and old ones are being improved. On the drawing boards, trains are born, which soon lower their wheels onto the rails, rushing into the distance to create additional lines of movement. Advanced factories are being built at an unprecedented speed; their production lines are continuously replenished with resources, transforming by the end of the shift into modern weapons. In Russia, a well-established connection between production and logistics has been created—the task of maintaining which becomes one of the main ones. The realization of this task rests on the ideas and spirit of tireless workers, tirelessly giving strength to the Motherland."

Thus, it gradually lost its own allies—those who could have gone with it because of similar ideas. Now, it is left only with pitiful puppets, ready to sever ties at every opportune moment.\n\nWe will not repeat such mistakes. Russia will find partners, colleagues, and friends on the international stage—those who will be ready to support the fight against the regime hated by all independent countries. We will appeal to the whole world with a call: it is time to destroy what the Nazis have built so long and cruelly. The Thousand-Year Reich must fall after a few years of calm—as a result of the united efforts of the most diverse powers. Russia extends its hand to the world and awaits its response. It will not be alone in its struggle. Not anymore... Never again."

Strengthening relations with the leading country of this world would not only increase our chances of receiving significant assistance but also strengthen our position on the international stage.\n\nThe time has come when oblivion and obscurity are replaced by treaties and mutual respect. The United States, with its powerful economy and armaments, can become a key partner in this struggle.

Their confrontation can play into our hands in the preparing war, opening prospects for strategic maneuvering for Russia.\n\nA diplomatic mission to Tokyo will become a kind of litmus test, showing intentions not only for cooperation with Japan against a common rival but also for further coexistence, which will undoubtedly strengthen ties and better incline Japan to an agreement with Russia.

The partisans must intensify their subversive activities, spreading chaos among the administrators of the Reichskommissariats.\n\nDiverse resistance groups, tireless in their efforts, need to be united under one banner. Their actions can become a decisive factor in preparing for the offensive, distracting enemy forces and destabilizing their control over occupied regions. The withered and plundered lands will be covered with the flames of resistance, and every blown-up building, every destroyed supply column will strike a blow to the morale of the occupiers."

When every day could have been the last. – Gil said.\n\n- I remember. That’s not something you forget. – Ardashev replied, still looking at the starry sky.\n\n- At the government and military council meeting, the Tsar clearly raised the issue of the necessity of liberating people and territories beyond the border with the Reich. Everyone passionately and enthusiastically supported the plan. But the shadow of the past—everyone saw it, and in everyone’s eyes, there was at least a drop, but still a drop, of fear of what lies ahead.\n\nGil paused, took a drag from his burning cigarette, and exhaled a cloud of smoke. Crushing the cigarette butt, he tossed it into the fire.\n\n- Now it is our task, and the task of the entire government, to ensure that the shadow of the past never returns. – Gil spoke, then stood up and looked at Ardashev.\n\nAfter a brief moment of thought, Ardashev also stood up, tossed his cigarette into the fire, and raised his eyes to Gil."

This was the countless time Nikitin and the others had disassembled and reassembled the rifle. Initial military training was mandatory for all boys from sixteen and encouraged for girls as well.\n\nStudents from schools, technical colleges, universities, and even institutes were required to undergo initial military training and maintain it.\n\nThe training included not only basic firearm handling but also first aid skills, wilderness survival basics, sambo techniques, and more.\n\n- Stop! – the instructor called again as Nikitin placed the assembled rifle on the table.\n\n- Good job, Nikitin. One and a half seconds ahead of time.\n\n- Next, Maria. Get ready... Start! – and once more, the stopwatch counted down.\n\nThe children clearly showed interest in the process, though not exactly joy—especially under the teacher’s watchful eye. A veteran of the West Russian War, he looked at them with a somber gaze. He knew what war was, what battle meant, and that death lurked everywhere on the battlefield. He was saddened that after so many wars—from the Great Patriotic War to the War for Reunification—yet another war loomed.\n\nHis colleagues and many others across the country shared his feelings. But the younger generation had only witnessed the War for Reunification at most, fought mainly by veterans, and did not truly know what real war was.\n\nThe instructor briefly lost himself in thought, nearly forgetting the ongoing drill.

I was tasked with appealing to the stronghold that has fought Nazism for many years—OFN—with a request for military aid to the reborn Russian state. Like you, we are engaged in an uncompromising struggle against a threat to all humanity—the Reich!

I’m starting to like this idea of mutual cooperation with Japan less and less. They still cling to ideologies similar to fascism. And historically, they’ve been a thorn in our side. – Gil muttered to his aide.\n\n- I agree with you, comrade. But today they’re rivals of the Nazi Reich, and that works in our favor. Plus, their help will reach us far quicker than aid from the Americans across the ocean. – the aide replied.\n\n- Hmm... Alright, you’ve convinced me. – Gil said briefly, reaching for his coffee.\n\nTen minutes later, the doors swung open, and the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs entered with his assistants.\n\nFor an hour and a half, negotiations took place, surprisingly concluding with an agreement to provide military aid to the Russian state."

It’s hard to imagine a more antagonistic regime, a more natural enemy, than the one partly created to destroy us. We cannot coexist, and only one idea can emerge from this inevitable struggle.

The trend is clear—if the second time brought us this far, we must finish what our fathers started.\n\nThe Reich must fall for good. Nazism must be driven from our lands, from Eastern Europe, and sealed within Germany itself, where it will rot away. Twice Russia has bled for this moment—only we can decide if that sacrifice was in vain. By taking up the banner of our fathers, we can end this cursed war. The Great Patriotic War was lost.

They slaughtered us, enslaved survivors, and bombed the rest.\n\nThe 'First World' is blind to our tragedy—and even to its own—but that makes it easier to shock. If we want to destroy the rotten Reich diplomatically, we must expose everything. We will form special teams to capture undeniable evidence and show the world what Germany did to Russia.

But this was the first time it happened not in peacetime, but during a war.\n\nSince the start of the Second West Russian War, the commander had to be driven around much more frequently—from report to report, again and again. But now, it wasn’t around the city or military bases; it was mostly along the front lines and rear areas. Memories overwhelmed him, and the sergeant recalled being a soldier in the First West Russian War, then the Wars of Unification, and finally his injury and concussion.\n\nSuddenly, out of the corner of his eye, the sergeant noticed the commander stepping out of the general staff doors and fully turned his gaze to him. The commander was an old battle-hardened officer from the Unification Wars. When they tried to discharge the sergeant due to his injury—despite his wish to stay in the army—it was this very commander who refused and saved him by making him his personal driver and bodyguard.\n\n— Comrade Nazarov, let's go. — The commander said lightly as he approached and settled into the back seat.\n\n— Yes, sir! — The sergeant replied shortly, tossing away the cigarette butt and getting behind the wheel.\n\n— Where to? — The sergeant asked.\n\n— To the airfield. — The commander replied. The car immediately headed towards the destination.\n\n— Yefim Palych, is it true we’re launching counteroffensives on all fronts and tearing the Germans apart? — The sergeant asked.\n\n— Yes, it’s true. We’ve launched the counteroffensive, and this is our final battle. Either we defeat the Nazis, or they defeat us... again. — The commander answered."

Not exactly imperial chambers, of course. Only our Tsar deserves such grandeur. — The great-grandson joked, also reaching for his cup.\n\n- Heh. Indeed. — The great-grandfather smiled.\n\n- I never expected to return to Russia someday. But my prayers were answered, and the empire—the Russian Empire—is back where it belongs. In its rightful place. — The great-grandfather said.\n\n- Listen, grandson. Where is your grandmother? Your mother and father? And why aren’t you at the parish school? — The great-grandfather asked, grabbing a bread roll.\n\- Great-grandmother is visiting friends. Mother is at work. I don’t attend the parish school—I study at a secular, well... partially secular school. Classes ended hours ago, so I came home to do homework and chores. As for Father... Father, like Grandfather, is at the front. Grandfather is a high-ranking officer, and Father is a junior officer. They’re restoring justice, like the others. — The great-grandson replied."

An air of anxiety and depression pervaded everything.

People lived in basements and sheds with rats, slept on cold floors, and prayed death wouldn’t come too soon. But knowing the Germans, they wouldn’t grant a peaceful end.\n\nA villager told the crew about an abandoned factory turned “concentration camp” by the Germans.

The stench of smoke was so vile, it reached the village.\n\nAfter further interviews with survivors, the crew headed to the third village, “Zhemchuzhnoye.” Upon arrival, they froze in place, stunned.

Everything was lost to them; they were exhausted, but endless reflection in the absence of tasks drove even these weary souls to fight for their right to live.\n\nThough the military promised a bright future, plans remained vague and unclear. Perhaps they were truthful, but the only thing sustaining people’s minds and hearts was hope. The Volga served as its symbol: its waters bathed those stained by war’s blood and dust. Many weakened, yet none intended to surrender to a void existence."

It... was pure hell...' The soldier’s voice trembled slightly. 'The Germans resisted however they could: they used every means to stop our advance.

He paused to wipe sweat from his brow and continued: 'In the end, we crushed them completely; some surrendered, some shot themselves, and a few got lucky and escaped. But a lot of good guys fell...'\n\n'What about the city itself?' one listener asked.\n\n'Ruins... Nothing but ruins and scorched earth! So much destroyed and blown up. People have nowhere to live now; they’re exhausted, scavenging for anything to ease their hunger. I don’t even know what it’ll take to restore the city’s original state...'\n\nOne officer rose heavily from the desk and slowly approached the soldier; placing a hand on his shoulder, he said:\n\n'We reclaimed what belongs to Russia. We paid a steep price, but we proved: from soldier to marshal, everyone is ready to fight for the Motherland! These battles aren’t just for fighting; our mission is liberation. And now our goal is to rebuild Baku and make it better than before.'\n\nThe soldier saluted and left the command room. He was clearly weary but hid it from others.

The beauties of the past fell one by one under stray shells striking majestic monuments, not to mention homes that once sheltered countless families.\n\nGerman citizens, fearing Russian retribution, abandoned Crimea en masse. The few who remained shared the fate of locals, escaping punishment for the destruction they deemed deserved.\n\nSevastopol—a city of timeless beauty—became yet another victim of war’s devastating toll. Now it has returned to the Russian Empire. A new light illuminated this majestic symbol of Crimea, and people emerging from their shelters began the labor of rebuilding the city from ruins.\n\nThe primary task was not merely restoring Sevastopol: it had to be reborn as a beacon of hope for the future. This city was to become an exemplar of unyielding resilience and the Russian people’s capacity for creation even after the harshest trials, lighting the horizons of days to come with a new glow of faith in renewal."

Such tenacity! The Germans turned our own homes—the outskirts of Kharkov—into impregnable fortresses. We advanced through minefields in chains, like walking a knife’s edge, comrades falling by the dozens under machine-gun fire. It’s a miracle... that I’m standing here.'\n\nThe major nodded, smoking a faded cigarette:\n\n'Losing Kharkov is an undeniable disgrace for them! But now it’s ours, and this isn’t just a victory over the Reich. We’ve struck a blow to their positions.'\n\nThe elderly officer gazed at the flames with weary eyes reflecting months of hardship, joining the conversation:\n\n'Kharkov is a key point for us. Victory here means so much... but the city lies in ruins! Factories destroyed, equipment looted or demolished by the enemy. The people... the few who remain look at the devastation and no longer believe in anything.'\n\nThe lieutenant, as if drawing new strength from the fire, declared: 'Yet we proved the impossible is possible!

They formed groups, creating partisan detachments ready to fight for the foundations of personal human freedom.\n\nTime passed, and the Second West Russian War began. Realizing their potential, they took up arms, ousting German administrators from their posts, eager to finally take a decisive step toward liberating the people. At the same time, Russian troops advanced through Moskowien until they reached the republicans. After lengthy negotiations, the government agreed to seamlessly integrate this group into Russian society. However, subsequent events forced the authorities to reconsider their approach to these freedom ideologues.\n\nMany who zealously championed the dream of a republic, instead of supporting their people in the liberation war, began propagandizing, spreading their ideals of democracy’s triumph and attempting to undermine the government’s authority during such a undeniably challenging time. This state of affairs didn’t go unpunished for long.\n\nSoon, law enforcement descended on the orators, detaining anyone suspected of agitating for republican ideas. Step by step, the authorities rooted out such individuals, eventually stamping out the perverse glorification of ideals contrary to the state’s stable existence during wartime. Within just a couple of weeks, only those republicans remained who had reconciled with the fact that a republic wouldn’t emerge, yet understood that during a people’s struggle, one couldn’t simply overhaul a system entrenched in the country overnight."

He requested permission and funding to organize and begin reconstruction across all of Moskowien. Attached was a detailed plan outlining key points and actions to address potential challenges based on unfolding events.\n\nAt first glance, his plan seemed far more promising than others due to its greater detail and clear staging of work.

The promised restoration results turned out to be a sham.\n\nAn investigation was launched against Pavlenko and his closest accomplices; however, it soon became clear there was no one to arrest: a fraudster, Pavlenko and his cronies had embezzled significant sums and fled to the USA. Extraditing the criminal for a fair trial was complicated by diplomatic efforts and the extradition process.

His efforts weren’t in vain: contacting the Russian army, he united his detachments with the Empire’s forces. He was thrilled to finally see, amid devastated lands, the faces bravely liberating kilometer after kilometer.

Buildings were shattered by bombings, and soldiers roamed the streets instead of residents, with the occasional survivor lingering.

He wished none of this existed. But he remembered they’d lost the battle for Moscow not once, but twice. No longer could he see this beautiful city in its ancient splendor, soaking in its centuries-old history.\n\nThe car reached Red Square, adorned with mock buildings and anti-aircraft defenses to shield the city center from bombings. Where the Minin and Pozharsky monument once stood was an empty, moss-covered pedestal. Gazing at it, Alexei began to sense the gravity of this turning point in the war.

However, an overly radical stance could deadlock the negotiations and undermine Hungary's willingness to conclude peace.\n\nSome circles are calling for the complete defeat of Hungarian forces, opening the prospect of a full-scale military campaign aimed at forcing Budapest into unconditional surrender.

But these trials have tempered us, and the Germans, without realizing it, forged the sword that they were eventually defeated by.

Sometimes it turns out to be war fatigue, sometimes a collapsing economy that was no longer able to support the war, but this conflict met with a different way to end the fighting.\n\nGermany, which watched with dislike every loss at the front with Russia, became increasingly convinced of the need to use nuclear weapons to stop the march of Russian troops. Now that the front line had reached the territories of the General Government and directly reached the German cities, the Wehrmacht High Command was no longer going to silently watch the crumbling empire. After a short period of drafting, the ultimatum was sent to Russia, which was given critically little time to consider.\n\nThe content of the ultimatum was for Russia to immediately stop its offensive, after which it would proceed to peaceful negotiations, where the fate of all territories that had become disputed in the current conflict would be decided. Otherwise, the Reich will not shy away from using nuclear weapons, which, if ignored, will go to the territory of Russia, and they will not care how it affects not only the country itself, but also the entire planet.\n\nSuch an ultimatum angered the representatives of our side, because such a barbaric decision deserves only condemnation and censure.

In any case, we need to decide what to do with all of this. \n\nAnd especially with the local settlers from Congo, the mixed-race descendants of Japanese, Manchurians, and Koreans who began to settle in Primorye in the early 1950s.

The majority of the German population in the former occupied central part of our homeland still remains in place. The government has prepared several solutions to this problem in advance, outlining the pros and cons of each. There were three main options:\n\n1. Expulsion of the German population to the German government-controlled territories. This decision will be unanimously supported by the Russian people, but theoretically, it will put us in a position no better than that of the Germans several decades ago. \n\n2. Resettlement of the German population beyond the Urals (Siberia, Northern Kazakhstan, Trans-Urals). This will be beneficial from an economic strategy point of view, but it will cause tension between the local population and the newcomers. Of course, the German people will be Russified. \n\n3. Allowing the Germans to decide their own fate also makes sense. The absolute majority will most likely leave, but the most vulnerable social groups may suffer from the local population.\n\nAll that remains is to decide the issue and convey the information to the local administration.

There are no significant industries here, and the local population consists mainly of peasants and farmers. To restore Estonia to its former glory, we will have to work hard, but for now, we need to decide how we will govern it.\n\nThe pearl of the Baltic - Riga - has returned to its home port. But besides the former Ostland's largest city and port, we have acquired a poor Latvian province where nothing is produced except for sprats. Moreover, the huge German minority, mostly composed of Latvia's urban population, is causing us a headache. The Latvians themselves are mostly illiterate peasants, and we do not see any joy from them in the change of rulers from Germans to Russians. Nevertheless, we need to come up with a plan for Latvia.\n\nWe have regained control over Lithuania, the western frontier of our empire. To say that Lithuania is unremarkable is an understatement; a considerable part of Lithuanians speaks only German. There is nothing here that interests us, but there is a huge number of German settlers. There is simply no industry here, except for the small family farms and the forced laborers in the mines.

Bringing the living conditions of ethnic minorities in the North Caucasus into decent shape will require enormous sums of money, or we can formally allow them to form their own quasi-states. \n\nThe Caucasus is also known as an invisible kingdom due to the thick smog, a former domain of a mad Reich commissioner that was the main source of oil and ore for the German economy. On the horizon, there is nothing but countless slave factories and crudely developed mines, and there is nothing left of the former beauty of resort towns but an industrial wasteland.

The once-created project of the Grand Duchy of Finland demonstrated the viability of broad autonomy for large ethnic groups. Maintaining autonomy could help avoid numerous issues stemming from national self-determination.\n\nThe third and final proposal asserts unconditional annexation of Finland.

However, in exchange for this gesture, Russia would gain the right to intervene in many spheres of Turkish activity, ultimately turning Turkey into a dependent state.\n\nThe second option was a classic annexation with the gradual integration of the captured territories under the direct control of the Russian Empire, definitively resolving disputes over the rights to use the straits.\n\nAn unexpected option emerged: the possibility of creating a separate, independent state uninterested in aligning with any external powers, establishing equal conditions for all nations.\n\nThe final proposal, devised to balance the preceding options, suggested the creation of an autonomous region, avoiding the difficulties of annexation while mitigating the risks of establishing an independent state."

However, third-party observers report that the epidemic stems from a mutated strain of viral pneumonia.\n\nIn Königsberg, a curfew has been established, and streets are undergoing constant disinfection. Additionally, there are reports of disruptions in food supplies to the city,导致 shortages of grains and toilet paper in stores. The severity of the quarantine is further underscored by rumors of extrajudicial reprisals against violators of the imposed restrictions.\n\nIt’s possible this outbreak is connected to events in Russian refugee camps near Nizhny Novgorod and German attempts to deploy biological weapons against advancing Russian troops. Representatives from the OFN and the Sphere have already expressed concern about the risks of the epidemic spreading further."

Initially, the source of seismic activity in this region lacked a clear explanation and was limited to speculation.\n\nToday, however, the global community received an answer. Russian authorities announced the successful completion of nuclear weapons testing. It has been revealed that nuclear research has been ongoing since 1969, though few expected it to conclude so quickly.\n\nAmid rising tensions between a united Russia and the Greater German Reich, the development of nuclear weapons is seen as yet another step toward escalating the looming conflict.

The German government issued a statement to its people, declaring the need for a preemptive strike on Russian positions to prevent further clashes with the eastern enemy, which had been concentrating large numbers of troops near the borders of Reich allies and conducting widespread military exercises for weeks. German forces then crossed the border of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, launching a broad offensive. In response, Russian representatives accused German leadership of pursuing an aggressive policy, merely seeking a pretext to declare war on the Russian Empire. Both sides are preparing to defend their interests and, according to their statements, are ready to use any means to achieve their goals."

Following its victory over Germany in the Second West Russian War, Moscow issued a statement condemning 'the inadmissibility of preserving Germany’s influence in the Middle East' and announced the launch of Operation 'Griboedov.' Russian Armed Forces have crossed the border of Shahist Iran, occupying several border settlements.\n\nIn response, Iran’s Empress Farah Pahlavi sharply criticized Russia’s 'barbaric-Jewish' actions. A program of intensified mobilization has already begun in Iran’s controlled territories, and the country’s military-industrial complex has been 'shifted to a war footing,' according to Iran’s Defense Minister. Russia’s overtly aggressive actions have elicited cautious approval from the USA and Japan, though no further steps have followed yet. Germany, meanwhile, has made no statements regarding the outbreak of this conflict, causing confusion and discontent among Iranian elites."
