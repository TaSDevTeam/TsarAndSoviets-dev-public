 MAR_united_russia_desc:0 "Finally, the moment has come. Despite all the circumstances and numerous obstacles on our path, we have achieved the impossible - we have united our great motherland, and the proud imperial flag is waving in every city. \n\nThere is still a lot of work ahead of us: Nazis threaten us with "forced pacification" in the West, the Japanese are tightly clinging to our historical lands in the East, and popular uprisings are tearing apart the territory of Siberia, but today we will celebrate; let the vodka flow like a river."
 MAR_allrussian_mladorossi_party_desc:0 "Our Mladorossi Party had its modest beginnings in a small town - Berezniki. Back then, our association was just a small spot on the map of the former Soviet Union, but over time, we expanded more and more. Soon, our party had full control over all of Western Russia, and after that, Western Siberia. Now, the Mladorossi hold all of Russia free from German invaders. We need to reflect this in the life of our party and attract fervent supporters of our regime from the Siberian and Far Eastern lands."
 MAR_partisan_problem_desc:0 "Despite the downfall of the last competing government regime on Russian soil, not all people are yet ready to accept our state into their hearts. On the conquered territories, there are pockets of resistance to the Mladorossi. Groups of dissatisfied radicals, like a rash on the skin, have become widespread and, despite their relative small numbers, pose a certain threat to our regime. We must suppress them at the outset and task the MGB and Gilya with this."
 MAR_siberian_amnesty_desc:0 "In the liberated lands of Russia, there were many state formations at one time. Some of them differed little from the bandits who had lost their humanity, but others had the rudiments of a strong state. In any case, these states disappeared, and now the flag of the Mladorossi is waving in their place. But despite the disappearance of their governments, key figures remained in place and are now in prison. It would be very wasteful for us to scatter such valuable personnel, especially considering that some of them have declared their intentions to cooperate with us."
 MAR_worldwide_recognition_desc:0 "To further implement our plan, we need to gain support abroad. The states that are members of the Pact of Unity and the Sphere of Prosperity are our main opponents, and it would be foolish to count on cooperation with them. However, the OFN member countries are more than friendly towards us and are willing to provide us with feasible assistance in the fight against fascist scum. \n\nWe will develop these relations gradually, starting by sending our Foreign Minister on a tour of the OFN countries, demanding recognition of our state as the sole successor to the Russian Empire."
 MAR_russia_trip_desc:0 "The monarchy has historically been a very important institution in our country. The fate of our great Motherland is closely linked to the kings and emperors of various dynasties, and we have no intention of severing this connection. Instead, we intend to show the common people that the emperor cares about each and every one of them. \n\nTo achieve this, Belozersky will go on a tour of the largest cities in the newly acquired territories. During his trip, the Tsar will demonstrate to the new citizens that they are in no way inferior or superfluous."
 MAR_allrussia_congress_desc:0 "Finally, our party is ruling over the lands from Arkhangelsk to Kamchatka, and we remain the only legitimate government on the territory of Russia. After so much time and effort, it is time to hold the first truly All-Russian Congress of Soviets. There, we will discuss options for the further development of our state, as well as our place on the world stage."

It was decided to send him to England, but only a fortunate delay in the message saved his life. And although he stayed in occupied Poland, Kazimierz, like millions of Poles, was waiting for only one thing - liberation. During his work in the Polish underground state, he became one of the prominent figures of Polish liberalism.\n\nWith the liberation of Poland by Russia, a new era began both in Sabbat's life and in the life of the Polish state - centuries of mutual enmity between the two countries were replaced by cooperation.

The official version of events states that with the active assistance of the Free Corps, Louis Ferdinand was released from captivity in record time. In reality, the RAF took Louis hostage with the goal of using his good name and popularity to spread left-radical ideas among Germans. Thanks to threats to both him and his wife's lives, the heir to the German throne played by their rules.\n\nThroughout all this time, the seeds of doubt and sympathy for revolutionary terrorists were sown through Louis' long and hard work. His popularity among the population played into the hands of the RAF, allowing them to carry out the necessary rhetoric all these years. Step by step, they cultivated support for themselves among Germans, particularly in Prussia. Despite traditional conservatism, Louis attracted enough attention from the average traditionalist, allowing even the most hardcore conservative to change their worldview.\n\nThe end of the war in the East marked a rise in popularity of old ideas, including monarchism.

The rise of the Nazis to power marked the end of Frahm's lawful activities and the beginning of his anti-fascist struggle, which lasted for decades.\n\nFor a significant period of time, he supported the Allied intelligence services and organized the appearances of political emigrants from Europe while in Sweden. As a Scandinavian correspondent, he tried to expose Germany's crimes across Europe, but soon it became ineffective. In the mid-1940s, he re-joined the SDPG and subsequently began propagating anti-fascist sentiments among German students, which had a special resonance in West Germany. Shortly before the outbreak of hostilities in the East, he moved to the Reich's territory to establish more compact connections between various anti-fascist organizations.\n\nAfter the end of the Second West Russian War, the territory of Rhineland was separated from the main part of Germany, and a crazy power struggle ensued. However, unlike other territories of former Germany, fair democratic elections were held here for the first time in a long time, resulting in the election of the youth's favorite, Willy Brandt, as the first president. \n\nWilly Brandt's task was simple and clear - to make Rhineland the most worthy place on Germany's corpse. The policy of denazification, democratization of society, establishment of international relations, and attracting investments are just the beginning of the Federation. The apathetic post-war society has yet to taste the fruits of democracy, which were taken away from them since the time of the Weimar Republic, whose legacy will become the foundation for the New Heart of Germany."

The Nazis fell and now Westphalia is ruled by the three D's: Denazification, Democratization and Demilitarization. At the moment Westphalia is the only functioning democracy in Germany, with all its pros and cons."

The SS mutiny allowed him to escape and join the Red Army, even though his views were not always in line with the Meinhof ideas, on the other hand they were still better than the Nazis.And when the Russians came Waldemar realized that this was his chance to set things right. With the members of the Red Army and the rebellious anti-fascists he managed to gain control of Hanover and get in touch with the government of the Empire.

After the German invasion and the proclamation of the Slovak Republic, he participated in the anti-fascist movement and maintained contacts with the underground resistance. Later, he organized a large socialist anti-government movement throughout Slovakia. He also supported the Czech resistance, which, however, suffered defeat after defeat due to the stronger pressure from Germany.\n\nThe political turning point came during the war between the reborn Russia and Germany. The entire Slovakia rose up against the Tiso regime, and Dubcek stood at the head of this popular movement. After the proclamation of the Slovak Socialist Republic and later the rebirth of Czechoslovakia, Dubcek had an enormous task ahead. Hunger, poverty, a devastated industry on the one hand, and cultural conflicts and ideological confrontation on the other. The country had to decide the fate of German heritage, Germans themselves, and their influence on the two fraternal peoples - Czechs and Slovaks. Political unity was also crucial, something Dubcek had striven for all these long years only in the territory of Slovakia.\n\nAlthough the present does not seem optimistic, everyone understands only one thing - Czechoslovakia's future lies in freedom. Only the persistent work of workers and peasants, teachers, and ordinary people will bring the future that they have been fighting for all these years."

Later, he joined a circle of socialist revolutionaries and embraced new convictions.\n\nDuring years of active socialist underground activity, Krenz witnessed much, from organizing spontaneous actions and strikes to repressive events he had read about and was now committing himself. Time passed, but the revolution did not come. German left-radical groups cut each other's throats in the hope that their ideas were correct and true. They fought for media attention by committing increasingly savage actions, losing support among the people. It seemed that only Krenz understood this. It was then that he decided to reconsider his views.\n\nEgon Krenz's theory is that to build socialism in Germany, it is necessary to adopt market elements and capitalism. It did not find wide support among revolutionaries, but the common people liked these ideas. Gradually, the number of supporters grew, and soon the movement became organized. It did not intend to abandon its radicalism but did not resort to terrorism. Krenz's organization collected weapons from across the country, preparing for a convenient moment for the revolution.\n\nGermany's defeat left the lands of Bavaria destitute and poor. It was precisely on this that Krenz focused. Taking power into his own hands, he set about building his Socialist Bavaria, which combines the best features of capitalism and socialism. He will rule this land with an iron hand, and only he knows the fate of the new Bavarian Republic. \n\nOnly occasionally, on dark nights, Egon Krenz remembers the tormented victims whom he sacrificed in the name of the revolution.

 MAR_Japan.17.t:0 "Vladivostok, home."
 MAR_Japan.17.d:0 "Today will be remembered by the residents of Vladivostok for a long time. Tsar-General Sergei Belozersky descended from his ship and stepped onto the city's embankment, where a crowd behind barriers greeted him with enthusiastic shouts. However, there was no time to waste, as the leaders of the partisan movement were coming to meet the tsar. All of them were dressed in old Soviet ceremonial coats. The tsar greeted each of them as if they were old friends and presented them with awards for liberating the Motherland from occupation. The oldest of the partisans, who was over seventy years old, approached the tsar and, taking off his fur hat, said, 'Many of us have waited for this moment for almost thirty years. Tsar-General, allow me to present you with the keys to the city.' At that moment, it became clear that the historical moment had arrived - Vladivostok had returned to the rule of Russia.\n\nThe conference that followed at the mayor's office and the joint declaration on the reintegration of Primorye into the Russian People's Empire became not only a formal act but also a symbol of long-awaited unity. After signing the declaration and holding a press conference with the leaders of the partisans, the tsar-general decided to hold another important ceremony - the opening of the Far Eastern branch of the Young Russian Party.\n\nUpon arrival, the tsar was greeted with loud applause from party members and local residents. He addressed the people of Vladivostok, assuring them that Russia does not forget about the common people and will do everything to ensure them a decent life and prosperity. Everyone who once fled to the north can now reclaim their rights to their old property. The Asian peoples forcibly resettled by Japan during its barbaric policy will have to either immigrate back to their home countries or assimilate and continue to engage in agriculture in this region.\n\nThe festive mood did not leave the city for a long time, and the streets were filled with people celebrating the return of the region to Russia. Leaving the city, Belozersky received a report from the MGB that the news of Vladivostok's return had sparked a chain of uprisings in the German-occupied lands of Moscow and the Caucasus."
 MAR_Japan.17.a:0 "We have only just begun."
 
 MAR_Japan.16.t:0 "Returning to the homeland harbor."
 MAR_Japan.16.d:0 "Not long ago, no one expected that the Primorsky Krai, which was under Japan's control, would someday be able to return to Russia. After all, it was still too weak to engage in any military actions with one of the three superpowers. However, now the flag of the Russian People's Empire is flying over these territories.\n\nNaturally, Russia's leadership visited the Primorsky Krai after the annexation. First, the Prime Minister Vladimir Gil visited there. He visited Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Birobidzhan, and other cities. There, he talked with the locals and promised them comprehensive assistance from the government, especially with the restoration of the cities' infrastructure.\n\nAfter some time, Tsar Alexei II decided to visit Primorye himself. He met not only with citizens but also with former partisans who had been provided with comprehensive support during the entire time. The Tsar thanked them for their heroic performance of duty. Later, they were awarded the George Cross, 1st Class.\n\nAlso, upon Alexei Nikolaevich's arrival in Vladivostok, the locals organized a real celebration. Everywhere, there were signs saying "Warm greetings to Tsar Alexei from the residents of Vladivostok," "Glory to the liberator Tsar Alexei II," and others. In the evening, Alexei Nikolaevich attended a banquet in his honor.\n\nWhen the guests began to disperse, one of the KGB operatives who were supposed to accompany Alexei II during his trip approached him and gave him an important message from Vladimir Gil. The message stated that thanks to the success of the partisan struggle in Primorye, partisans in the Reichskommissariat Moskovien began to engage in similar activities as in Primorye."
 MAR_Japan.16.a:0 "Soon, we will be celebrating in Moscow." 

 
 MAR_Japan.9.t:0 "Call from Harbin"
 MAR_Japan.9.d:0 "Gill leaned over the scattered military plans of Primorye, deeply absorbed in thought. He needed to mark the new locations of the Russian Empire's troops on the new territories, but suddenly a piercing ringtone sounded.\n\n"So..." Gill's gaze fell on the newest secure phone. It was external intelligence from the MGB, and a call from them meant only one thing - urgent information.\n"Gill, on the line," he said when he picked up the receiver.\n"Vladimir Vladimirovich! Our Harbin operatives have urgently contacted us. They report that the Manchurian rebels and Kim Il-sung's partisans have started an open rebellion against the Japanese and their puppets. The government's army has not yet been able to react, so if we send troops now to support the rebels, we have a good chance to strike back at Japan and push the Sphere even further out of Manchuria," the MGB officer on the other end of the line reported.\n\nGill understood that this was very important information, and he immediately asked for a full report to be sent to him. Then he hung up abruptly and grabbed another phone, preparing to make another call."
 MAR_Japan.9.a:0 "We need to call the Tsar..."

 MAR_Japan.10.t:0 "Activation of Partisans in the Far East"
 MAR_Japan.10.d:0 "In recent weeks, there have been a large number of attacks on garrisons, derailing of trains, fires, mysterious deaths, and disappearances of officers of the Kwantung Army in Outer Manchuria. There is no doubt that Russian underground forces are behind this. Against the backdrop of Russia's recent reunification, the increasing activity of partisans does not seem accidental.\n\nToday, a representative of the Russian resistance arrived at the headquarters of the Far Eastern Military District in Blagoveshchensk. They are requesting our support in the upcoming uprising against the occupation authorities. There is no need to delay the answer; the Japanese have already started to deploy forces from the islands to suppress a possible rebellion."
 MAR_Japan.10.a:0 "For now, we will observe."
 
 MAR_Japan.11.t:0 "Activation of Partisans in the Far East"
 MAR_Japan.11.d:0 "To General Gille. \n\nOn the territories of the Khabarovsk Krai, Amur Oblast, and Primorsky Krai occupied by the forces of the Japanese Empire, there is a sharp increase in partisan activity. \n\nIntelligence reports daily armed clashes between garrisons and partisans, resulting in high losses on both sides. The battle near the village of Desna deserves special mention: skillful actions by the command allowed the partisans to destroy a warehouse of light weapons and the garrison of the Kwantung Army guarding it without suffering any losses. \n\nThe partisan forces are predominantly made up of the Russian-speaking population of Manchuria-controlled territories, in addition to a significant number of fighters from the Korean population. Our intelligence assumes that there is a similar organization in Korea that resists Japan, but we have not been able to track it down. \n\nThe partisans operate in a centralized manner, with a command chain built according to the Soviet model, but also have separate autonomous cells deep in enemy territory. The presumed leader of the Far Eastern cell is Captain Sergei Zaikin. \n\nThe innovative actions of the high command and the high morale of the partisans allowed for a grand operation to be launched in Manchuria, threatening the stability of the entire region under Japan's control."
 MAR_Japan.11.a:0 "It's time for us to act."
 
 MAR_Japan.14.t:0 "The Battle for Khabarovsk"
 MAR_Japan.14.d:0 "Alexei Grishin, once an illustrator, but now, by fate, an official in the printing yard of the kingdom, was completely absorbed in his work: the reform of banknotes was imminent, and therefore the issuance of new banknotes. He thought for a long time about which city to choose for the image on the five thousand ruble banknote, and to distract himself, he turned on the radio on his windowsill. From the transmitter, the announcer reported in a lively voice: \n\n"Today, at 9 a.m., the last surrounded forces of the Japanese Imperial Army surrendered in Khabarovsk, and the city was finally liberated by the troops of the 2nd Army Corps of the People's Movement for the Liberation of the Far East. In honor of this event, 12 volleys will be fired from 124 guns, and Khabarovsk will be given the title of the city of the first salute." \n\nAt that moment, Alexei made a final decision: the newly designed banknote will feature the liberated Russian city of Khabarovsk."
 MAR_Japan.14.a:0 "Victory of the Russian will."
 
 MAR_Japan.15.t:0 "Battle for Khabarovsk"
 MAR_Japan.15.d:0 "Captain Zaikin sat at the table in a carefully camouflaged field headquarters. In front of him was a map of the area with pencil-drawn front lines, and a stationary radio station stood to his right. The captain had not slept for three days, and the accumulated fatigue knocked him off his feet, but he continued his work. He was in charge of over a thousand soldiers, and the fate of each one was in Zaikin's hands, and he was not going to scatter them. The captain thought about the further plans of the battle, when his thoughts were interrupted by the crackle of the radio.\n\n"Base, come in, over! Amur 2-3, calling Base, over!"\n\nZaikin grabbed the radio. "Base here, Amur 2-3, report, over."\n\n"Base, this is fucked up. We are under heavy enemy fire, we are getting killed here. We have lost almost half of our personnel. Requesting orders to retreat and regroup, over!"\n\nZaikin broke out in a cold sweat. "Received, Amur 2-3, stand by for further orders. Hang in there, guys!" Zaikin changed the frequency on the station and picked up the radio again. "Base, calling Zvezda 1-1, report on the situation, over."\n\nA hoarse voice began to crackle from the speaker: "Zvezda 1-1, reporting heavy losses. Ammunition is running out, cannot advance, over." "Copy that, stand by for further orders."\n\nThe captain closed his eyes. The battle for Khabarovsk was lost. But it is not the end, we lost the battle, but not the war, the real battle is still ahead. For now, we need to regroup for a new strike. Captain Sergey Zaikin picked up the radio... \n\n"All units, I'm giving the order to retreat!""

Expulsion of the German population to the German government-controlled territories. This decision will be unanimously supported by the Russian people, but theoretically, it will put us in a position no better than that of the Germans several decades ago. \n\n2. Resettlement of the German population beyond the Urals (Siberia, Northern Kazakhstan, Trans-Urals). This will be beneficial from an economic strategy point of view, but it will cause tension between the local population and the newcomers. Of course, the German people will be Russified. \n\n3.

There are no significant industries here, and the local population consists mainly of peasants and farmers. To restore Estonia to its former glory, we will have to work hard, but for now, we need to decide how we will govern it.\n\nThe pearl of the Baltic - Riga - has returned to its home port. But besides the former Ostland's largest city and port, we have acquired a poor Latvian province where nothing is produced except for sprats. Moreover, the huge German minority, mostly composed of Latvia's urban population, is causing us a headache. The Latvians themselves are mostly illiterate peasants, and we do not see any joy from them in the change of rulers from Germans to Russians. Nevertheless, we need to come up with a plan for Latvia.\n\nWe have regained control over Lithuania, the western frontier of our empire. To say that Lithuania is unremarkable is an understatement; a considerable part of Lithuanians speaks only German. There is nothing here that interests us, but there is a huge number of German settlers. There is simply no industry here, except for the small family farms and the forced laborers in the mines.

On the horizon, there is nothing but countless slave factories and crudely developed mines, and there is nothing left of the former beauty of resort towns but an industrial wasteland.

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_F_DESC:0 "The sleepless nights of recent months have had a bad effect on Tsar Belozersky's health, but they have not led him to the miserable condition in which he now finds himself. Hundreds of thousands of ruined lives now hang in his balance, like holographic marks on a card. Those he could not save, those who died in his crusade of fools, those whom he left behind on his path to the throne... All these sacrifices turned out to be in vain. He is the murderer of Russian hope.{nOnly with such a burden on his shoulders is the choice between the bottle or the noose. Sergei Sergeyevich, to his shame, chose the bottle. It is shame that fuels his endless binge drinking, and the desire to escape from this bitter feeling that forces him to down another shot. There is no escape from nothingness. There are only endless cycles of guilt."
 POLITICS_RUTSKOJ_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Despair. Bargaining. And finally, Anger. \n\nThese were the very feelings Alexander Rutskoi was experiencing as he watched the reports from the fronts of the new Patriotic War. Russian guys were dying under the bombing and artillery fire because of incompetence of the Mladorussian command, while Rutskoi was forced to deal with the problems of savages in the steppe. Last time he was still a baby, but now he will try to save Russia from itself. One more time. \n\nThis time, Sanya the Mad will not trust the bureaucrats and useless nobles. §RHis country will be in his hands and it will be stronger than ever. No matter the sacrifices he has to make."
 POLITICS_BEK_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "If only he had known how things would turn out in the end, maybe Kazem-Bek would never have organized the Young Russians and would have continued writing books about religion and pining for a lost Russia. But he couldn't, and for the sake of honesty he couldn't. Homesickness. \n\nIn betraying his country and joining the forces of Tsar Vladimir, Alexander put an end to his destiny. At the time when Russia was uniting and strengthening he forgot about his deeds. But as always, the road to hell was paved with good intentions. \n\nAnd now the leader of Mladorossov is sitting in Berezniki again, depressed and devastated, he doesn't know what he should do next. Every day his heart is getting worse and he has less and less hope. But now he is sitting like a real king on a sword chair, standing on a field full of blood, ruling his kingdom of ashes."
 POLITICS_BEYRLE_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Joseph Byerly's life can be described as a series of disasters and betrayals. At a time when victory in the war seemed in his hands, fate destroyed that dream, and then did it again, already in the Western Russian War. Byerly seemed to have found his place in life when he joined the Young Russians. Reaching the position of Tsar Belozersky's favorite general, he became the tip of the spear that was to smash the colossus of Europe... \n\nThis all turned to ashes in an instant. Now the Czar General is dead, and his general is certain that the only culprit is Kazembek, the head of the traitorous Mladorosses. Byerly no longer cares about the fate of Russia or the necessary sacrifices. His goal is to clear the good name of his comrade-in-arms, to avenge the murderers of the Tsar, and to allow the descendants of Belozersky to rule Russia... Whatever it may be."

First the Reds, then the Germans, then the Reds again, the forces of Tsar Vladimir and finally the Mladorosses, time after time he thought that he had seized fate by the tail and finally won. However, each time fate proved that it knows how to joke. \n\nMaybe then, during the Second Western Russian War, when Gil's headquarters came under artillery fire, Vladimir really died, his mind fading and dissolving amidst machine gun fire, shouts on the battlefield, and endless artillery strikes. In spite of this, the general's body continued to walk, in spite of fate, in spite of the world, and in spite of intelligent design.  \n\nAnd it's not going to stop."

 MAR_Collapse.1.d:0 "For the last few days no one saw Sergei Sergeyevich. He locked himself in his office, periodically asking for more and more bottles of Vyatka from his supplies. However, for the past twelve hours he has not done this either. The guards did not dare to go in as they were well aware that in this state of mind the Tsar could without hesitation order anyone to be shot for no apparent reason. The defeat in the war had a great effect on Belozersky's mental state, as it probably did on the state of all the inhabitants of Russia. His dreams of a just retribution and a long and happy life were shattered like a shot glass of still unfinished vodka falling from the weakened tsar's hand. The sound of the broken glass was probably the last sound that Sergei Belozersky heard before he finally lost consciousness. \n\nFourteen hours later the guards decided to enter the cabinet. They were faced with a rather pitiful sight. The whole room was littered with bottles of varying degrees of content, especially many on the desk. In addition to the bottles and shot glasses the Tsar was lying on the table. The soldiers, smelling something amiss, having asked a few questions without getting an answer, decided to go closer to the body and check for a pulse. There was no pulse. The doctor, who arrived at lightning speed, after a brief unpretentious check, stated:"

Antipin shouted the loudest, or rather squealed: "Repent! Repent before it's too late! You're all lost! Do you hear? You're all lost!" \n\nWhen one of the ministers who hadn't yet gone into a frenzy tried to stop the overexcited priest, he took a huge cross off his chest and charged him in the forehead. The minister, who clearly had not been prepared for this in his life, immediately fainted. \n\nKazem-Bek, who decided it was time to end it all, thought of shooting his service weapon into the ceiling, but realized that it was no longer on the table where it had been kept. \n\nWhen he looked at the bacchanalia going on, he saw the only person sitting quietly and not getting into any kind of altercation with anyone. He was sitting in the corner of the office with a smile on his lips, unlocking his service weapon, which belonged to Alexander Lvovich. He was about to stop him, but did not have time. A mixture of blood and brains splattered the wall. \n\nAt the sound of the gunshot the guards came and stopped the brawl, and Kazem-Bek, who had returned to his office, started thinking about what to do next."

Perhaps by controlling all the minutiae Maria tried to distract herself from the frightening thoughts about her future fate. How much war can change people's lives. Especially the defeats in it. Not long ago it had seemed that the Vyatka's life would last forever, and now they had to go to the other continent in the hope that they could at least get by there. \n\nAll this thinking had kept her awake for the past week.

There was an explosion and the sound of flying glass - a grenade exploded nearby and blew out the shop windows. The woman shuddered. She could hardly keep from bursting into tears. Yesterday's best candy store in the capital was in ruins, and the BMP drove over the cake that had been in the window in the morning, but now spilled over the sidewalk. \n\nSuddenly the loudspeakers started blaring. The voice coming out of them was familiar to almost everyone. \n\nAttention! Stop your senseless resistance! We are the lawful authority and the guarantor of the country's security! Anyone who surrenders voluntarily will be guaranteed life!" - Alexander Kazem-Bek's speech resounded loudly. \n\nOlga already knew this message by heart. It had been two days since the troops had entered the capital, though it seemed like a whole year. \n\nFifteen minutes later, when the rattle of the caterpillars was barely audible, she decided to leave the basement. When she saw what her life's work had become, the work her father had bequeathed her, who had given everything he had for this place to thrive, the woman turned pale, fell to her knees, and sobbed. "

However, the lucky people who grabbed the gifts of fortune were waiting at the door for the same ones who were trying to grab the blue bird by the tail. \n\nIn about 20 minutes the whole thing turned into a mass brawl. \n\nBut retired police captain Pronin, a lifelong law enforcement officer, had no intention of leaving things as they were. \n\nTaking his service pistol, the man went to the parking lot. He found a life-beaten truck there, smashed the glass with a brick he had found in the driveway, and, with some simple manipulation, started up the truck and drove it downtown. \n\nBefore he reached the crowd about 500 meters away, Pronin got out of the car and put the brick on the gas pedal. The 8 tons of steel crashed at high speed first into the crowds, who had not had time to disperse, and then rammed through the door, blocking the passage to the station.

Several Foreign Ministry workers ran out upon seeing the MGB uniform, but the officer was focused on more important matters.\n\nHe cracked open the door to the minister's office. A young man was sitting behind the desk, nervously sketching new Russian borders on a map with a pencil.\n'Where's Demichev?' the officer asked.\n'Demichev is gone... We received several telegrams yesterday. Our allies, for whom we spilled blood in Africa and the Middle East, have disavowed us. Maybe out of fear of the Pact, or maybe we've just become so pathetic that even a poor country like Sudan can now wipe their feet on us. Everything that Peter worked on for a decade has simply vanished. Our mandate in Turkestan is sending us blatant threats. Add to that the recent death of the Tsar and our third defeat in a row against Germany. Peter just couldn't take it anymore.'\n'It's terrible. I'll report this news to the Regency Council, but first I need to know where the agreement on cooperation with the OSN is.'\n'I would say that's even worse than Demichev's death. The entire package of documents disappeared right after the Tsar's death. I have a suspicion about who did it, but the bastard has already handed over the documents to Abwehr or Kempetai. The State Department will refuse to work with us when they find out.'\n'Why the hell didn't you call us right away!'\n'We did call, Peter himself called, but the MGB guys are just so busy...'\n\nThe officer nervously sat down at the desk, trying to compose himself, but his gaze fell upon a map of the homeland. The new border of Russia in the west had recently been sketched in pencil and ended at the line between Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan. All of Primorye and Khabarovsk with Blagoveshchensk had been stolen by Japan. A single fat question mark stood on everything east of the Urals."

We have assembled the first battalions from local recruits. The officers have already found a common language with them. All our garrisons are in excellent condition, and considering that they did not participate in the European campaign, we have a very strong advantage over the Regent Council's troops.\n"Early to rejoice, adjutant. Don't forget that our operation must be quick and precise. We cannot risk our garrisons fighting against their former comrades.\n\nSeveral officers nodded sadly at these words.\n\n"We still have a few more days to prepare.

I sent them three garrisons to maintain order, but the Regency Council keeps asking for more! Have they lost their minds? Recently, the mayor of Almaty asked for an expansion of autonomy, and what am I supposed to tell him?" Vitaly asked, expressing his concern.\n"Vitya, I understand that we have a common problem, but it's more important what's happening on the streets of the capital, not what we tell the mayor of Almaty. The situation is about to get out of control any day now," Wojciech continued, emphasizing the importance of the situation.\n"I've been asking myself more and more often. Should we even continue to maintain communication with Vyatka? After all their failures, it can't get any worse, but I'm afraid they'll do something even worse than their past failures," Vitaly said thoughtfully.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by an adjutant who burst into the office: "Mr. Governor, we're under attack from the direction of Turkmenistan!

The last time he was here was just before the Soviet government deprived him of his powers. Inside, to his surprise, the decor was not as destroyed as he had assumed. He looked around and saw only minor traces of the battle, a couple of dead soldiers and the smoke from grenade explosions. The palace's interior was mostly untouched.\n\nEveryone who entered was greeted by a large painting of Sergei Belozersky, the first and probably last Tsar of the Russian People's Empire. Kazem-Bek least of all wanted to make eye contact with Belozersky, so he immediately began ascending to the council chambers. Alexander entered and grinned. Four ministers were arrested, four out of ten. The fate of the remaining six was unknown, but judging by everything, they either perished or had already left Vyatka, and maybe even Russia.\n\n"Alexander, we surrender! We surrender, do you hear!" the council secretary muttered plaintively.\n"You left me no choice, gentlemen. And now leave..." Kazem-Bek said, interrupting him.\n"It was you who left us no choice, you degenerate! Think about what you did today! Think very carefully about where this will lead!

Did I understand correctly that the Americans warned you in advance?"\n" Yes, we both know that the Japs wouldn't have stopped at Primorye this time, so the CIA urgently searched for a strong Russian man, someone who could make the Japs abandon their plans for the Far East."\n"And here I am, how lucky it all worked out," Vladimir smirked.\nThe evening passed with a bottle of strong moonshine, as the two men discussed their fears and risks, but equally understood that for the first time in many years, a Leader - Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky - would appear again in Magadan."

 MAR_Collapse.14.d:0 "Some time has passed since Zhirinovsky arrived in Magadan. Looking out from his office at the streets of his new capital, the Far Eastern People's Republic, Vladimir Volfovich sighed thoughtfully. Yesterday, his country was granted observer status in the OFN. This meant that the threat from the east would recede - at least for a while. However, if the enemy was bold enough to strike again, what would change on the third time? Vladimir returned to his desk, where piles of promising papers were waiting for him. Lists of volunteers from all corners of the world, weapon supplies from the OFN arsenal, credit agreements with America, conscription campaigns in Chita and Amur. But despite this, the general was feeling somewhat melancholy. People will likely call this the third Time of Troubles, but if he acted quickly, there was still a chance to avoid much bloodshed. Otherwise, Russia would face a disaster. The last disaster.\n\nIraq's jackal unfolded a revised map of Russia on his desk: he needed to decide who among the traitors to the Motherland he would send to the scaffold first. In the west, Joseph Bayerly had taken all of Siberia, where he retreated with his army immediately after his defeat in the Moscow Campaign. Joe will definitely be a lot of trouble, but he must first be reached. Therefore, he will have to start with one of these two, the Republic of Sakha or the Republic of Buryatia. While Zhirinovsky was trying to decide who would be the first victim of his ambitions, the phone rang.\n\n-Hello, Vladimir Volfovich? This is the Foreign Ministry. You are urgently called from Buryatia.\n-Connect me, please. - Vladimir said confidently. \n-Good day. You are speaking with the Secretary-General of the Republic of Buryatia. Can I assume that I am speaking with Mr. Zhirinovsky? - a female voice said.\n-Yes, it's me. What would you like to discuss? - Zhirinovsky responded, tapping with a pencil on the spot on the map where the territory of Lake Baikal was highlighted.\n-My name is Susanna Pechuro Solomonovna. We would like to conclude a non-aggression treaty with your country. - she said insistently and confidently.\n-As you know, everything has its price, Susanna. What can Buryatia offer us in return? - Zhirinovsky set a condition, thinking about how to mark Buryatia on his map."

'I have a rough idea, but you won't like it,' replied Mikhail. 'Shut up, damn it!' the soldier hit Misha with a punch to the solar plexus, causing him to gasp for air. Both guys were deputies in the Tomsk City Duma, representing the Bastillyard's Salon. However, today they were arrested and shoved into the truck during a working meeting.\n\nThe truck continued on a smooth road, then on a dirt road, and finally off-road. They stopped. The soldiers pulled the hostages out of the truck and put them on their knees.\n\n'Shurov Ruslan Dmitrievich and Fartov Mikhail Andreevich, both Bastillyards. Is that correct?' The deputies nodded their heads in agreement.\n'Yes, that's us. Where are we? Why did you bring us here?' 'Here, I ask the questions,' said the man with an American accent. 'When was the last time you contacted Kazem-Bek?' His voice sounded oddly familiar.\n'Kazem-Bek... He called us almost right after the war. We didn't discuss anything special, he just consulted with the Tomsk Duma on how to proceed,' Mikhail replied.\n'Then you should already know that he is the one responsible for what happened to the Tsar,' the stranger claimed.\n'No, it could have been anyone, but certainly not him. Abwehr, Kempetai, maybe even Gill considering what happened to him, but definitely not Kazem-Bek. And maybe the Tsar just died? He wasn't young, after all...\n'I've heard this voice somewhere before...' Ruslan whispered, realizing who was in front of them.\n'You have ten seconds to tell me how involved you are in the conspiracy against the Tsar. Time is running out.'\n'Listen, the chaos in the capital and what happened to the Tsar is a consequence of losing the war and the internal weakness that followed. There was no conspiracy against the Tsar, there was only...'\n\nSuddenly a shot rang out, cutting off Mikhail's nonsense.\n\n' I remembered where I heard your voice...

 MAR_Collapse.16.d:0 "The situation in the Urals seemed critical since the end of the Second West Russian War. Based on the assumption that German forces would not stop at the Archangelsk-Astrakhan line, Gil made the decision to send his troops to the Urals, occupying cities such as Zlatoust, Yekaterinburg, and Chelyabinsk. But the tactical retreat served only as a cover for an open rebellion near Vyatka. No one and nothing could stop the insane general from his crazy idea of building the Russian National Republic in the Ural Mountains. The industrial centers of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust are being rebuilt in the likeness of Muscovy and are working to the point of exhaustion. Non-Russian population is forcibly deported to the Vorkuta camps, which, unfortunately, have opened their doors again for all dissidents. All of this is tied to Gil's insane militarism. Therefore, when the new regime organizes another massacre on Russian soil, it was only a matter of time. The path to Vyatka had to be retaken through the Urals, and it would be too difficult to hold onto the lands of Kazakhstan. The Joe Beyrly Regency could have given in, and Gil's gaze fell on the Tyumen Republic - a newborn democracy under the control of President Primakov. The general's order, which finally sealed the fate of the Tyumen Republic, had already been signed. His goal was to burn down the last stronghold of democracy in the Urals."

But this lair was fortified with metal, and a huge steel door stood in front of it. Kazem-Bek stood in front of multiple monitors, but even here he did not feel safe. The security system cameras transmitted images of the empty streets of Vyatka and the surrounding area of the palace.\nThe regent council was disbanded, but its shadows still haunted Kazem-Bek's consciousness. He could not forget their mistakes that led to the new turmoil. The new field commanders had once again torn the country apart after the king's death. But Kazem-Bek did not despair. He knew that western Russia was still under his control, and that meant not all was lost. They had simply returned to where they had started. And suddenly, one of the monitors caught Kazem-Bek's attention. An armored car drove up to the entrance of the palace, from which several people got out. Alexander immediately recognized them. A CIA agent with his bodyguards walked through the palace. Entering the regent's office, he was not surprised by the increased security measures, as if it should have been that way.\n\n"Mr. Alexander, have you been informed of the incident in Mezen?"\n"No, what happened there?" Kazem-Bek replied.\n"Unknown persons with weapons seized our ships carrying humanitarian aid and raised the flags of the Russian Empire on them. The militants have already been destroyed, and the cargo has been unloaded, but several US citizens were killed." Kazem-Bek tried hard not to think about where this ominous conversation with the CIA agent was leading.\n"Listen," he interrupted the agent, "there are many spies and traitors all over the country. Maybe this is a German provocation?"\n"Our contacts in Moscow have reported that you are no longer of interest to the Germans," continued the CIA agent.\n"The country is in a difficult situation now and needs time. We will now deal with the separatists. Therefore, we need your weapons supplies and assistance with...\nBut the CIA agent interrupted him, not letting him finish. "What nonsense are you talking about? This was the last time you disappoint us. We will not give you another chance."\n\nKazem-Bek felt that the situation was getting out of control. The agent was already a few steps ahead and turned away, ready to leave the room. "Wait, you can't abandon Russia in its hour of need. You have always helped us!"\n"No, but we are abandoning you. We have found a more promising and cooperative candidate in the Far East."\nKazem-Bek was struck by these words, and in the end, he realized what had happened. "Is this what you wanted, Mr. Kazem-Bek?" said the agent and walked away.

The state has reunited under the legitimate leadership of the Prime Minister of the Russian People's Kingdom, Alexander Kazem-Bek.\n\nAccording to sources, the founder of the Mladorossi idea, Alexander Kazem-Bek, managed to do the impossible again by destroying his opponents and former comrades in the internecine struggle. This led to the reunification of the state after a long period of civil war. However, the country was ravaged by the Third Time of Troubles and has not fully recovered from the defeat in the Second West Russian War. Nevertheless, hope for the future of Russia has not been lost. The Prime Minister announced the gathering of a new Zemsky Sobor, modeled after the one in 1964, but this time on a nationwide scale.

First, he joined the side of the Third Reich during World War II, then during the First West Russian War, he fought on the side of the Little Russians against the Revolutionary Front. And finally, after the Second West Russian War, he and his army went to the Urals, from where he later went on a rampage against all his opponents. Now this man is the sole ruler of what is left of Russia.\n\nNew Russia is a country that has inherited all the worst from the Little Russian kingdom and multiplied it by Gil's nationalism. Total conscription and the cult of militarism feed Vladimir's endless armies, while non-Russian population perishes from slave labor in factory cities. Gil's war machine holds the entire country in fear with an iron fist. It remains to be seen whether this madman will start the Third West Russian War."

The Russian Empire was destroyed in 1917 during several revolutions, and its successors failed to replace each other, dying one after another. Today this cycle has closed, and Dmitry Dmitrievich Vasiliev proclaimed the formation of the Russian Empire once again. Vasiliev, the leader of a small group of radical nationalists and fanatics, began his journey by capturing the Russian North, and then the whole of Russia. The new empire is a semi-fascist agrarian state, having only the name from its former imperial glory. The place of the tsar in this fake kingdom was taken by Dmitry himself. Autocracy has been restored in the country, xenophobia, protectionism, folkloric patriotism, and the omnipotence of punitive bodies that commit constant repressions are flourishing.\n\nMany are afraid for the future of Russia, which seems to have taken a dangerous path, while others welcome the return of the empire and believe that Vasiliev will lead the country back to its former glory."

However, today this country has loudly announced its victory over the remaining fragments of Russia. Vitaliy Mukha, a man who started as a small official and later became the governor of Kazakhstan and then the ruler of all Russia, leads the new state. The new state is based on the ideas of social nationalism with some elements of the Eurasian program of Nikolai Gumilev, a Syktyvkar radical. However, behind this brilliant appearance lies internal contradictions and uncertainty about the goals of the new country. As history shows, political turmoil and inept policies can tear a state to pieces. But the people, tired of constant civil wars, remain passive observers, ready to watch the development of events until something truly catastrophic happens.

Most experts have argued for a natural death from old age, stress, and alcoholism. However, Joseph Bayerly thought differently. A close friend of the Tsar, a veteran of World War II, and a US soldier who fought for the USSR, these are just a few interesting facts from his biography. Joseph was fully convinced that the Tsar's death was prepared by Alexander Kazem-Bek, the former head of the Mladorosses. The thirst for justice helped Bayerly and his loyal troops to suppress all resistance and establish control over the capital. Now Joseph is trying to start the process of transferring power to the relatives of Belozersky, but so far no one has come forward to claim it. At present, more than 130 political figures and ordinary citizens across Russia and abroad have been charged with the Tsar's death.

The armies of Tatars and Bashkirs were able to successfully repel all attacks on Kazan and take control of the remaining territory of Russia.\n\nHowever, as experts note, the current government will not be able to govern the new territories for long. Therefore, the question of creating a confederation consisting of autonomies, where Tatars, as well as Chuvash, Bashkirs, Mari, Mordvins, and Udmurts, will take a leading role, will be decided in the near future."

Primakov fulfilled his promise and, having destroyed Gil, acquired one of the most powerful industrial complexes, with the help of which he liberated the rest of Russia. The Russian Democratic Federative Republic revives the tradition of Russian democracy and quickly finds recognition among the population. \nThe next step will be the adoption of a new Constitution and the creation of parliamentary bodies that will allow Russian citizens to participate in the management of their country.

Zhirinovsky himself became the head of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, but as part of his vision, a Conservative Party of Russia should also be created. Despite being on a course of liberal-democratic development for Russia, his government is preparing a revanchist campaign and, if not to restore the borders of the 1940s, at least to push back the enemies to the positions of 1972.\n\n'I would like 1980 to be a peaceful year, but I love the truth.

However, due to the lack of full control over the newly acquired cities, it was decided to reorganize the system of government according to the principle of communes. International experts were clearly puzzled by this decision since Susanna's government could easily revive the council system, but apparently this is the exclusive specificity of utopian socialism, the new Union. Former Cossack anarchists warmly welcomed Susanna's new vision of Russia. However, it is difficult to say how this system will fare in other regions.

He gathered an army from garrisons, volunteers, and retreating armies from the Caucasus and conducted his campaign to cleanse Russia. Thus, most of the old general staff and incompetent officials were repressed.\nCurrently, the country is at a crossroads, and Rutskoy plans to hold an all-Russian referendum to address a range of new Russia's state issues, such as preserving socialism and planned economy or transitioning to capitalist rails. However, the most pressing issue of the referendum will be whether Russia needs to enter into a new confrontation with the Pact and the Sphere."

By now, such papers have become the main enemy of the field marshal, that even being shot by Werewolf Partisans dull in effect compared to the fear of being buried under a pile of documents: under the window of the temporary headquarters, screams are constantly heard, and someone even threw stones at the guards, but they were quickly dispersed. But today, today was a special day— the Decree on Denazification signed a week ago finally came into force and it is only right that the leader of the GUOT should have been personally present at the event. \n\nGil pulled on his jacket and went out into the street, entering his car's backseat. Germania now looked much less friendly than usual, but it didn't matter anymore. As the Germanmade car moved, the GUOT leader noticed all the marks the fascists; street names, plaques, or still-standing monuments, the biggest of which-the Volkshalle—imposed upon the horizon."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.2.d: "And so the car arrived at the Volkshalle, the former symbol of the greatness of the German nation. The majestic building was noticeably battered, artillery and air raids broke through the roof in several places, and the eagle, which previously towered at the very top, lying broken near the entrance. Nevertheless, the building still inspired some feeling of trepidation even in this state. "They certainly knew something about architecture," Gil thought to himself as he approached the zone where the main show was supposed to take place, at a safe distance where all kinds journalists, photographers, and ordinary onlookers gathered to look at the end of the majestic building. Security, of course, did not allow anyone to be close enough but the very sight of journalists made Gil sick. As soon as he joined the crowd, a young woman immediately approached him in the company of an operator, his camera etched with hieroglyphs that Gil could not even read, much less understand. "Hello, dear viewers, now we have Vladimir Gil, head of the German Office of the Occupied Territories and proponent behind the so-called, Denazification Decree. One of the major points is the demolition of the 'People's Hall' seen before us, do you want to add something on this?" Asked the presenter of the state TV channel, offering a microphone to Vladimir. \n\nLeaning slightly, Gil began to speak: "Yes-today, as part of Denazification efforts, the Volkshalle will be demolished, afterwhich denazification will begin in full force, eliminating all manners of monuments, the names of institutions of streets, and all other references to the fuhrers and national-socialism as a whole. There will also be trials of NDSAP members and their accomplices, historical injustice will be corrected." Finishing, he smiled and turned to the sappers, already waiting in position. Under the spotlight of both foreign and Russian journalists the lead sapper ceremonially approached Gil, saluting. "The sappers have carried out the order, waiting for further instructions!" \n\nGil picturesquely took a few steps forward, raised his right arm, and reported; "At my command! One, Two, Three!" Afterwhich he waved his raised arm to the sight of explosives devices detonating simultaneously, bringing down the beams and pillars of the structure afterwhich it fell, seamlessly dissolving into the ground with a large shook, a large wave of dust appearing afterward. Observing the situation for a few more moments, Vladimir Gil spares no time, lifting his feet and returning to his car-there is work to do."

There is no end in sight to the discontent of the Germans. \n\nAt one point, something went particularly wrong—in a protest near Gil's motorcade, one especially angry protester escaped from the crowd and tried to release several bullets into Gil's car. While bullets from Tsarist guards restraining the protests reached him first and he was unable to run far from arrest, the suicide-explosion that he did reached the guards and some protestors, luckily having been done some distance from the cars. Soon, firearm shots rang from the buildings and crowds, a clear sign of a Werewolf ambush. \n\nThe skirmish did not last long, and the ill-equipped fanatics cannot surpass protecting Tsarist troops.

Much more often, Russian soldiers helped rescue people either from rubble or from the captivity of very desperate Werewolfs. Liberated people are then given first-aid medical assistance if neccesary and a survey to clarify their previous place of residence, after which they will be sent home by train. \n\nThus, many Czechs, Poles, Jews, Russians, and many more are given a better world, second chance and a ticket home.

Is there even a point in it? \n\nThese are questions often lingered upon by the Central European Garrison's esteemed leader, but not today. Today, he is faced upon a special condition, and certainly a justified one. The man he is faced with are not conscripts, and not even concentration camp guards. No, they are a mix of reichskommissars, gauleiters, collaborators, and other disguting filth: architects of genocide and the industrialists gladly supporting them. The court had given their verdict, and now it is up to Beyrle for the direct administration of some well-needed justice. \n\nPerhaps he can make them suffer—just as they had inflicted to the millions-but by then, how will his liberators differ from these... monsters in human skin? Certainly it is God's duty to see to them, but his to send them up nonetheless. He took out his pistol, extended his right arm, and took aim, along with the squad at his command."

Power had previously stripped the honest veteran of everything he held dear, all starting with the two world wars and descending into the west russian war, the civil war, and now, the russian occupation of his fatherland. Said Russians had come, bombed his house, and hanged an old aquaintance, leaving the man with nothing but to live on. \n\nNot only do they bombed his house, but also the plumbing. While they had promised to eventually repair it-good of them-they shouldn't have broke it in the first place, and he personally doubted their promises. And so Hans now walked daily, carrying buckets of water back from a nearby well. On one of his daily trips, he in interrupted by a severe back pain, forcing him to gently lower his buckets, tried to straighten up, and re-lift the bucket, when he caught glance of an oncoming russian soldier, looking at the old man with some confusion. Already heard of what the soldiers did to german civilians—robbing, killing, or even raping for fun-he took a few steps back, obviously not boding well. It was supposedly as revenge for what his nation did twice, but that was already so long ago! \n\nThe soldier broke the running thoughts in his head, asking if he needed any assistance. \n\nHans did not understand russian however, and it seems that the soldier didn't understand German either. Thus, he shook his head and pointed at his ears warily: it isn't the clearest way to display his misunderstanding, but he didn't think of it at the fear of the moment. \n\nInstead of any fantasies Old Hans might have gotten, the soldier simply shrugged, raised the buckets, and shook his head questioningly. Hans stood still for awhile, then pointed to his house with his hand, as the soldier silently walked to such direction, the old man trotting after him. \n\nSomething is certainly wrong here—the soldier didn't seem to resemble the brutish mongoloid the newspapers told him. Is it a ruse? Propaganda? Maybe an act of kindness, only to be shown as tyranny? Hans thought, his head hurting. Perhaps those questions should maybe be directed to the fatherland he blindly served for so long, instead of people he had never even met? He knew the nazis lied, so why is it beyond reason to think that they lied here too? Why is it so hard to believe such? \n\nOld Hans began to break, tears threatening to roll out. As the Russian soldier placed down his buckets of water, he turned around and wiped some sweat, smiling. Hans observed him closely-the man is young—not much older than the average Germam conscript, so what is the difference anyways?

In addition, he had heard more and more whispers about strange happenings in the Czechia, from the soldiers in particular. Something is clearly wrong, but he couldn't do much in such obscurity so he simply tried to refocus on work. \n\nWhen mail came in, Beyrle caught sight of an unmarked brown folder that easily contrasted itself among the generally white pile, catching the commander's attention who instictively move to open it, only realizing the potential security risks afterward. \n\nLuckily, what came out is no trap, nor a bomb, but images; pictures of killed Germans with Czech soldiers standing nearby, photographs of eviction processes, and many more. \n\nWhoever took these images was certainly involved, but also wanted people to know about it. \n\nThe Commander of the Central European Garrison immidiately took up his telephone to report the incident to the GOLT.

These formations will have the power to evict and move the colonizing German away from their stolen homes into special camps located outside cities, but fear not: when you meet them in your daily duties in the reconstruction of our beloved nation, DO NOT discourage them, for they perform a sacred duty! A duty to clean the Czech State of the German taint, assisted by efforts of Degermanization and Denazification through all manners of places and peoples, but also particularly in languange. All German names will be changed to Czech, and our great Czech languange shall be the only legal languange of the nation, with German banned to be spoken in public. \n\nThe Czech State will be for Czechs, and for Czechs ONLY!" \n\nThat was the end of Alois Grebenicek's speech, now deeply imprinted into Czech memory. Reactions are mixed—some moved to celebrate, others to flee. Yet, all are distracted by fanfares that are heard through the nation, men of the newly formed National Security Battalions proudly passing down streets, dragging with them Germans of all age and sex out of town. The onlookers stare dumbfoundedly, preferring to remain silent in contrast to the occassional minority cheer, but Battalion members proudly chant their motto at the top of their lungs:"

 TaS_GEREpilogue.9.d: "The last battalions were being trained while the rest were preparing for the operation. National Security units were stationed all over Bohemia and preparing for the so-called 'Czech Night,' an operation to drive the Germans out of the borders of the Czech State. A special effort was made by propaganda, which urged ordinary citizens to stand in solidarity with the troops. Finally, hours before the operation began, a decree was read out at the battalion locations to deprive them of criminal responsibility for killing Germans who resisted the expulsion. \n\nAnd then, at last, this day came. After Alois Grebenicek announced the beginning of the operation, pogroms against the Germans began throughout Bohemia. According to a prearranged plan of action, the battalions began to act. Breaking down the door of an apartment or a house, they drove the Germans out into the street. Resisting Germans were shot on the spot. They were formed into columns and driven to the border, disregarding casualties among the Germans. The main objective, to expel the Germans from the Czech Republic, was carried out by any means necessary. \n\nBy morning, Operation Czech Night was over. At least, its first stage was over. Now several problems had to be dealt with: the Germans had to be driven out of the Czech territory quickly. Each battalion had five trucks for this purpose. The Germans were crammed into them as much as possible and driven to the nearest border. Alois Hrebeníček congratulated the National Battalions on the air, but reminded them that the operation was still going on. At last revenge on the Germans has come true!"

 TaS_GEREpilogue.10.d: "Operation 'Czech Night' took the Germans of Bohemia by surprise. Most of them were unable to stand up to the National Security fighters, so they were taken prisoner. But not in the Sudetes. The Germans were in the majority in the Sudetes, and thus they were able to give a decent response to the National Security battalions. But the forces were unequal, and therefore all the Germans were systematically shot. This turned the former Wehrmacht soldiers into a frenzy, which is why Kurt Knispel put his own men into insurrection. \n\nThe training of his soldiers, their caches of weapons and their motivation enabled them to successfully fight the Czech troops. But to act in daylight in enemy-controlled territory was veritable suicide. That is why his unit decided to go into partisanship. Small counterattacks on National Security units bore fruit - the unit grew rapidly and initiated skirmishes with the enemy not only at night but also during the day. \n\nIt soon got to the point where all Czech military formations in the Sudetenland were attacked by Knispel's troops. Because of that they were forced to leave the Sudetes, the "Česká Noche" operation there was hastily curtailed. For now, Grebenicek is in no hurry to send his troops into the trap and is waiting for Knispel to make a mistake. The latter, in turn, adheres to the same tactic. In addition, the Czechs began to be driven out of the Sudetes, using the same methods as Hrebeníček. One thing can be said with certainty so far..."

Alois was clearly distraught: he did not expect that Gil and Beyrle would find out the truth about his house. \n\nThey are expecting an answer within the next hour," said the telegraph operator. \n\nFuck," Alois muttered to himself, "make up any answer you want, but don't talk about all the shit we've got going on. \n\nThat's right," said the telegrapher and went back to his room. \n\n"We have to act!" - Hrebeníček thought and immediately started writing orders to the troops. "Due to the difficult situation in the Sudetenland, I REQUEST that the German militia be destroyed, that the infrastructure nodes be taken over and that the 'Czech night' in the Sudetenland be terminated!" This order was sent out to all units of the Czech army. The commanders immediately moved their subordinates to the area where the alleged "Remains of the Wehrmacht" were located. \n\n\n\n Expect that personnel losses will begin to grow exponentially, but one cannot go against the order ... so also Grebenicek demanded to act quietly and unnoticed by the GUOT and the Garrison, because he has no answers to the questions."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.12.d: "The incessant stream of calls was already tiring Walter out. He had hoped to be finished by 6:00, but it was almost 8:00. Requests for funding, solutions for captured Nazis, Red Army rampages-all this pestered him all day long. The second chance Schmidt got, he made the most of it. \n\nBut at last the phone was going silent and Schmidt could rest. Pouring a glass of whiskey, he reflected on his situation and looked out the window. The sunset blinded him, and he involuntarily turned away. People were walking home to the tinkling sound of birds. "Beautiful!" - thought Waldemar. After drinking the contents of his glass, he started making phone calls again. \n\nSuddenly there was a knock on the door. "Sorry, I'll call you back," said Waldemar on the phone and let him in. It was Andreas Baader, his former comrade-in-arms, one of the leading members of the Red Army along with Ulrike Meinhof. \n\nHello, old chap," Schmidt said cheerfully. \n\nNice to see you too," Baader replied. \n\nWhat are you doing here? - Schmidt asked, filling his glass with more whiskey. \n\nThanks, I'm good," said Baader. - I'm here on business. \n\nWell, spit it out," said Schmidt enthusiastically. \n\nMy guys here found the location of the werewolves. We'll try to handle it peacefully, of course, but we can't rule out an aggressive scenario, either. Would you mind turning a blind eye to this event? \n\nYeah," Schmidt said without any initiative. You understand the risks, right? \n\nAbsolutely, Walter, but their crimes are out of bounds, you know? \n\nOkay, but this is the last time, okay? \n\nAll right, Waldemar, all right," Andreas said enthusiastically and hurried away. \n\nThere were certainly many more such requests from members of the Red Army and other armed formations, and Waldemar tolerated them. "It is better to know the enemy than to be in the dark about him," Schmidt believed."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.13.d: "The streets of Hanover were deserted, the streetlights came on, and Baader went to the bar. No, he didn't want to flood his position. The bar was the meeting point with Meinhof. Ever since the democratic government in Westphalia had been established, her life had become much closer to the end. \n\nAt the appointed time, Baader was in the bar, drinking yet another glass of good beer. Suddenly, someone grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and dragged him out the back door to the street. \n\nYou're out of your mind! - Meinhof hissed, "Have you seen werewolves in a bar? \n\nI-I just..." mumbled Andreas, who had been drinking heavily. \n\nLet's get out of here before anyone sees anything. \n\nOkay. \n\nThey walked in silence, occasionally glancing at each other to assess the situation. Finally, when they arrived at the park, they could discuss their plans. \n\nSince the collapse of the German Reich, the Red Army has lost a significant number of participants, as many consider the objective accomplished. But we know there's still a lot of work to be done," Meinhof said. \n\nWe need to start a new wave of propaganda. There are a lot of young people out there who are ideologically minded and looking for a vocation. \n\nI agree, but we have to be careful, we're close to collapse. Before Meinhof could finish his sentence, a bullet from a werewolf gun hit him in the chest. Immediately, Baaden fired indiscriminately at the supposed location of the shooter. When he heard a moan subside, he lifted Ulrika up. \n\nDamn werewolves..." Meinhof barely heard her say. \n\nStop! Wait! You can't do that! - Andreas shouted. - There's still a lot of work to be done! \n\nRemember... You... must... continue... the... revolution... in Germany... Right, Comrade Meinhof... She no longer showed any signs of life. Baader had to get away from the murder scene in a hurry. He walked over to the shooter and emptied the whole magazine into him. Now he knew where to go."

Expecting another day of routine chitchat with various people, he brought his lunch, so as not to be distracted during working hours. The first calls, the first tedious problems, and the first tedious answers. Nothing new. But Baader's appearance came as a surprise. \n\nHe burst into the office uninvited, saw Walter hanging up the phone, and began: \n\nThey killed Ulrika, Waldemar, they killed Ulrika! \n\nWho did? - Schmidt asked in bewilderment, a half-eaten sandwich in his hand. \n\nThose bitchy pigs are werewolves. In the street, Walter, you know, in the street! - Andreas said, out of breath. \n\nI hear you. - Schmidt said grimly. \n\nNo, Waldemar, you don't understand shit! - Andreas said. - She died in my arms. I have to carry on her work, our work, you understand? \n\nWell, I'll have a funeral... What the fuck kind of funeral, Waldemar? - Andreas interrupted. - Those bastards are going to come back and shoot all of us. They have to be exterminated. All of them. Every last one. I'll do it myself, just give me the okay. \n\nYou want to massacre the werewolves? - Waldemar asked. \n\nYes, that's what our time demands. - Andreas affirmed. \n\nNo," said Schmidt calmly. \n\nWhat do you mean no? - Baader, who was taken aback, asked again. \n\nI will not allow war to break out in the streets of Westphalia. My only and final answer is no. I understand your pain, but it is too much. - Schmidt explained judiciously. \n\nYou're gonna be sorry, okay? You're going to be very sorry! When the flames of the revolution hit Germany, you'll beg for mercy, but I won't give you shit, okay? You'll be very sorry! You'll rot in the same ditch as these GREAT VERVOLFs! - Andreas Baader shouted as the guards forcibly escorted him out of the office. \n\nSchmidt looked out the window. The sun was already illuminating the central square. "I hope Ulrika will forgive me and him," Walter thought. After standing for a while, he sat down again at his oak table, and with a bitterness in his heart he realized..."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.15.d: "Preparations for the establishment of the Constitution were underway in the parliamentroom. Politicians from different parties took turns expressing their opinions on the draft, its pros and cons, and the very meaning of issuing the Constitution at such a time. And while the narrator's monotonous voice was in the air, Maximilian - the head of Baden - nodded silently as a sign of propriety. \n\nFrom the very beginning, he urged his colleagues to let him go and hold the meeting without him, but they were adamant. "If you're not there, there's no point in gathering," they objected. Maximilian was happy to cancel the stupid event, but something inside made him come. \n\nHe'd been here for about an hour and a half, and the voices kept changing and changing. "Lord, are there a thousand of these people?" - The newly minted monarch spoke to himself in a pleading voice. His status and position were almost incidental. Without knowing it, he found himself the closest heir to the King of Baden, or so he thought. Either way, he didn't know how and didn't want to rule the state, but that's how fate turned out. \n\nIn his mind, he cursed everyone here for daring to pull him out of his beloved winery. He had been one of the best winemakers in Baden, but now he had to sit and listen to the chatter of these uncles. Deeper and deeper into his thoughts, Maximilian did not notice how he fell asleep. However, he was not much concerned about it, if he had found out. Still, sleep would be much more useful than "hearing the bill for a new constitution for the Kingdom of Baden-Württemberg."

Spending time at the winery was what he considered the best and most rewarding activity of his life. Picking up his personal driver and part-time winemaker best friend, he was in his workshop in half an hour. \n\nAfter chatting with the workers, whom he knew personally and with whom he was on good terms, he went to his taster friend, Duck Salder. Maximilian complained about his troubled life. Duck offered him a fresh red semi-dry wine. The monarch gladly agreed and, after thanking his respected friend, he hurried to his study. \n\nBut today he decided to be more or less productive - to read. But he chose wisely. "After such a busy week, we should rest!" - thought Makimilian and took "Sherlock Holmes" by Arthur Conan Doyle from the library. Pouring a glass of wine and sitting in an armchair, he began to drink it judiciously, trying to understand the most subtle notes of taste. But the first glass ended too quickly and Maximilian could not understand it. Then he drank another, another... when the bottle was empty, the Monarch's hands first dropped, then the book fell out of them, and finally he fell asleep sitting in his chair."

Looking at the glass of his house, Maximilian saw cracks sprawling all over the window and a bullet hole in the center. Although he did not fully understand what had happened, he decided to crawl into a closet and get dressed. Suddenly Maximilian heard gunfire outside his window, someone screaming and some people coming into his house. Half a minute later, the men of the Kingsguard, a special unit of the forces, entered his room. The most important of them all seemed to say, "Your Highness, please come with us," and he held out his helmet. \n\nAll right," the winemaker agreed timidly, and they headed for the exit. \n\nAlthough he wanted to know more, his instinct for self-preservation did not allow him to do so until they were in the car. \n\nWhat's going on? - Maximilian asked. \n\nAn attempt has been made on your life, Your Highness," the soldier replied gruffly. - After passing certain laws against former Nazis, they have decided to overthrow you and your government. According to the information we have, there is a fascist uprising in the west of Baden-Württemberg. The leader of the uprising is none other than Ernst fucking Remer. \n\nSo what do we do next? \n\nI think we should take you to a safe house and ask for instructions from Berlin. \n\nWith the answer to his question, Maximilian was silent and took one last look at his house, his winery, and realized:"

His decision to start the uprising at a time when Russian troops had already crossed the Oder was an indicator of legitimacy for Moscow. Gil personally came to him to discuss the terms on which Scheel would be the head of state. \n\nSuddenly the telephone rang. When he picked up the phone, he heard: \n\nHello, is this Walter Scheel? - the man asked. \n\nYes, it is," Walter said with a little surprise. \n\nI'm glad to have this conversation with you. I have a very interesting proposition for you. - the man said. \n\nWell, I'm all ears. \n\nYou see, I've had quite close ties to the Nazis in the past, and I'm one of the leading industrialists, so I'm afraid for my life. \n\nAlright, I understand. - Scheel answered. Could you give me the opportunity to settle down in the Rhine? But in return, I am prepared to give you complete or nearly complete protection. In addition, my subjects are willing to work for you. Agreeing with me is in your interest. \n\nAfter pondering the proposal for a few seconds, Scheel finally answered: \n\nWell, I think your offer is quite favorable. I'm willing to give you the land and take care of all the paperwork. \n\nFine," replied the industrialist, "I'll explain the nature of this security later. \n\nOkay, goodbye," Scheel ended the conversation. \n\nAnother Nazi fled to the Rhine from the oppression of the new governments. And Scheel made the difficult decision to harbor them. In return, he was getting valuable employees and other useful things, like the same protection. But he was beginning to suspect that such volumes might make many people wary, including the Garrison and Gil. So he should have reduced the flow of such refugees. But he was too fond of profit."

"Not bad overall, could be much worse. \n\nI'm glad to hear that. But I'd like to ask you, how long will you be hosting the Nazis? Gil probably smirked when he realized the tricky nature of the question. \n\nI'm going to stop taking them soon. \n\nSoon, when is that? - Gil continued. \n\nWithin the next month. \n\nOkay, but how many Nazis have you taken? - Gil was getting more and more obsessive. \n\nHow should I know, I don't keep records. - Scheel replied. Your rough estimate. \n\nAbout a few hundred officials of all stripes. \n\nOkay, Walter. You know I love you, so I don't pry into your business, but just know that you can only do this for the rest of the month. \n\nNaturally, Vladimir. I'll have that gate closed right away. \n\nOkay, I'll talk to you soon. \n\nI'll talk to you soon. - Scheel replied and exhaled. No one had ever asked him for that much information before.

 TaS_GEREpilogue.20.d: "The situation in the Rhine has changed dramatically in the last few weeks. After the flow of Nazis began to be artificially reduced, scattered units of werewolves flocked there in droves, intending to change such a situation. Scheel may have suspected that they would want to change the situation, but the way they did it came as a complete surprise to him. \n\nBy 10 a.m., several trucks full of werewolves with guns had arrived at Strasbourg's central square. They surrounded Scheel's administration and did not allow anyone to come near him. Soon their ringleader made demands: the armed formations in Strasbourg must lay down their arms and Walter must surrender with his guards. Scheel was given half an hour to think about it. \n\nHe was in a desperate situation. The Werewolves had cut the cables of the telephones and most of the telegraphs. Walter was doomed. He asked the head of the encirclement to let the women out of their staff and they, after thinking about it, agreed to comply. "Now my conscience is clear," thought Scheel. After half an hour the werewolves demanded an answer. If they refused, they were going to blow up the building. Soberly assessing the situation, Scheel agreed to surrender the garrison of the city and himself. \n\nWhen it seemed that nothing could save him from certain death, the Nazi fighters began shooting at him from different streets. Scheel decided to take matters into his own hands. Taking a machine gun from one of the dead fighters, he began shooting at the werewolves. Soon they decided to spit on Strasbourg and go far away, but the roads were blocked. Then they had no choice but to surrender. \n\nIt turned out that one of the soldiers had been on vacation in the Rhine capital when the Nazis invaded. He was not confused and immediately reported to his comrades, who immediately rushed from nearby units to Strasburg. Walter Scheel personally congratulated this fighter and said that he would be awarded a medal. \n\nWalter, already reeling from the early shock, was reflecting on what had happened. "You know, this is just the beginning," Walter said to himself, "the Nazis feel their power, that's why they attack. And they're right about something." The silence was interrupted by a phone call. Scheel already knew who it was. Moscow. Gil or Byerly. It didn't matter. We've got to think of something urgently to keep them from removing him from office."

Among them were several former Reich officers, soldiers and even one very decent-looking industrialist. Late at night, however, they tried to sit as quietly as possible so as not to attract the attention of the Bavarian military. \n\nTime passed slowly and they were beginning to get nervous. The young officer, Heinrich, approached his old acquaintance, Siegfried, they had served together in the German army, fighting in the Civil War and the Second West Russian War. \n\nDo you think," Heinrich began, "that maybe he ditched us, took the money and took off. \n\nLook, I've known Max for a long time, he's moved a lot of people across the border, don't worry. \n\nHe's been gone a long time, I think someone's watching. \n\nBuddy, it's just nerves. It'll be fine. Maybe you're right. \n\nHenrich sighed and even calmed down a little bit when suddenly the clearing came alive. It all started with a single shot in the air, then the glade was retreated by the armed men. Eventually all those who tried to escape were loaded into a truck with the symbols of the Bavarian State. Max stood nearby and watched the whole thing. Did he feel guilty about it? No, he was taking revenge on the Nazis, would he continue to do so? Yes, he won't forget what they did to Maya, ever."

The patrols of the Bavarian forces changed several times, I think it was the fifth. \n\nHis head was throbbing and his eyes were watering, but he kept going. Around him stood them, soldiers, unwashed and unshaven, not long ago they had been slaves, and now they stood over him. They laughed, they cheered, the music clearly pleased their ears, but their strength was running out and soon the former Reich soldier would be unconscious. \n\nAnd then he couldn't help himself, he couldn't take it anymore. "Please... let me go... I was just a driver... I... I'm sorry," the unwilling musician shouted. Soon he felt someone pat him on the shoulder. Through the humming in his head he heard, "Calm down. And then with difficulty he raised his head and opened his tear-shrouded eyes and saw the barrel of a gun pointed directly at him. In just a moment the white keys were covered in blood mixed with the remains of the Nazi's skull. "We'll have to tell the next one that the concert is over," pronounced one of the soldiers. "Yeah, he was starting to falsify towards the end anyway," said the other one. So the squad left the building leaving the musician lying on the floor, the next patrol will take the body."

He pondered the reasons that led to the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I and that if they had won, the world would not have seen the horrors of Nazism and Fascism. \n\nHe had forgotten all about the time. It was almost 10 p.m. In his hurry back to life, he headed home. Walking through the streets of his beloved Vienna, he involuntarily thought about other cities. Berlin, the capital of the world, had been transformed by Albert Speer into an ugly concrete colossus whose main purpose was to demonstrate the power of the Nazis. Rome suffered much less under the Nazis, but was nevertheless also turned into a "show of force capital". But it is amazing how well preserved Vienna is. Its old streets with their alleys and nooks still reminded him of the old days of the Austro-Hungarian Union. \n\nnUnWhen he got home, he looked at Vienna and realized..."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.26.d: "On this day nothing foretold trouble. Otto von Habsburg went to work as usual. As he was writing his report to the accounting department, a panting young guardsman suddenly ran in and said clearly and firmly, "Your Majesty, the reds have risen in the north of the country!" Otto was surprised, but clearly not confused. After pondering what he had said, he replied, "It was to be expected. In our 'brave new world,' there is no other way. If you give power to the right, the left will rise, and vice versa. The world is changing. You can't change anything." \n\nThen he fell silent and stared out the window for a long time. The sun was just reaching its zenith. The greenery was pleasantly soothing to him. But in the distance he could see the dark clouds coming in. A storm was coming. "What are you going to do?" - The fighter asked, already out of breath. Otto looked out of the window a little longer, then turned around, sat down at the table and said with pain in his soul, "As fearless as the Austrians are, so stupid are they. Send out the army." The soldier, after hesitating a bit, waiting for another "most interesting" lecture, nodded his head and rushed to the phone. \n\nSoon Otto called his assistant and asked him to dial Gil. Otto, being a lover of accuracy, was going to paint a picture of what was happening in Austria. It might, of course, have caused anxiety in Berlin, but he knew for certain that the Austrians would listen to no one else. Thinking over his words again, he dialed the telephone. \n\n "Yes, Mr. Otto, Vladimir Gil is at the machine," said a clear voice.

Not only had the original plan to seize the territories of Westphalia and Baden failed and the local leaders miraculously escaped death, but the cursed Baader had also spoiled everything with his rebellion. \n\nWest Germany looked more and more like a patchwork quilt, ripping apart before our eyes. As he approached the city, Otto-Ernst heard the sounds of air defenses and the thundering explosions of exploding artillery shells, indicating that the Rhineland Alliance forces intended to go on the offensive in the region and push back the Werewolf forces. The Reich General could not allow this to happen. \n\nOnce there, Otto left the armored personnel carrier and saw the new army with his own eyes, unwashed, hungry, and with frantic eyes, the last of the Reich loyalists looked like this. The situation was depressing, and then the commander's mind began to flood with memories. Of the campaign of '41 and the fight against Russia, even though it initially seemed that the expanse of Russia would swallow the German war machine, he proved that the German spirit was invincible. And now he will prove it again. \n\nAs the commander-in-chief approached the headquarters, the thought suddenly flashed through his mind that the war he was now engaged in was only an echo of that war more than 30 years earlier. Every word was another bullet, every order a grenade. And at the head of it all stands the soldier Remer, the last Loyalist turned warrior, who stands and conducts the army like an orchestra, destroying everything..."

 TaS_GEREpilogue.28.d: "Since morning Salzburg was turbulent. Left without orders from above, the garrison of the city opened fire on the rioting workers at night, which was a fatal mistake, and by seven o'clock the garrison was completely overwhelmed, the bodies of the executioner soldiers were hanging on the street poles, giving the whole place an atmosphere of a kind of madness. A revolutionary frenzy that did not abate for a minute. \n\nBy ten o'clock, a total pogrom of shops, banks, police stations began. All this became the target of popular anger. A little later, the arsenal fell to the onslaught of the crowd. And at the head of it all was Baader, who had personally arrived in town. \n\nAround lunchtime he stood on the square surrounded by ordinary people, tired of the oppression of the bourgeoisie, of the Nazis and Russians who had occupied these lands and later handed Germany over to loyal czars. Now was clearly not the moment for long and loud speeches, but Baader knew what to do. In a couple of jerks he climbed into the armored vehicle like another leader of the revolution half a century earlier and began to push his speech. "Comrades! To the workers of Austria and Germany. The time has come to throw off the shackles of imperialism, to wrest Germany from the hands of the bourgeoisie and foreign influence. Today the bourgeoisie has given us an unheard of gift! They gave us a machine gun! With which we're going to beat down the cities of those who are not ready to accept the revolution. And you are witnessing the birth of a new Germany, free, honest and strong! So let us comrades make the great leap toward communism and free the motherland from its clutches," when Baader finished he decided to take a better look at the crowd around him. \n\nThese were not ragamuffins, not expendable material to be burned in factories. There were people cheering, and shouting. They were ready to follow Baader anywhere, even to hell, just to make Germany great again. The only thing Baader was thinking about now after the inspection was unusual, however. He distanced himself from the crowd and from the noise and thought, "What will be the last sound I hear? I hope it's a gunshot..."

The heroes of ancient times and modern times came to life before him. The pictures in general had an incredibly powerful effect on him. \n\nThen the war broke out, in which Kurt felt like a major hero, or at least they tried to make him one. "The most effective tanker in history", "Hitler's tank ace", he was literally showered with titles and became a hero to many. But deep down, he didn't understand, was that war necessary? Still, sometimes wars are fought for no particular reason. \n\nAfter the war, he just wanted to be alone, but he couldn't. Even a house in the Sudetes, a family, and a decent amount of servants couldn't drown out the sounds of his conscience. Every night he woke up with nightmares. And every morning he would rather leave, preferring to spend his time outside. \n\nAnd now the tanker got a chance to be a real hero to his men. He climbs back into the tank, knowing the night is short and the goal is far away. He swore to the Germans a long time ago that he would protect them to the last man and now it's time for him to keep his promise.

The enemies of the new Germany were defeated for the moment and one could even rest a little. With sluggish, lubricated movements he did get to the closet and looked at his uniform, all dirty with drops of blood... "We'll have to order a new one later", thought to himself the general. Nevertheless, almost to the door he decided to sit on the chair, a couple of minutes will not do anything now. \n\nBut then the unexpected happened. A sharp knock on the door broke all the plans of the new Führer. On the other side stood a young soldier, looking slightly inappropriate: frantic eyes, disheveled, something was clearly wrong. "Rockets! The Russians have launched!" - no formality, no appeal, but even that was enough to make Otto's pupil dilate. His heart raced and it was as if a concert had begun, squeezing out what was left of reason in his head. \n\nIt would be very difficult to describe the events further. Remer jumped into the armored personnel carrier in a state of rage and made his way to the nearest bunker. His mind was jumbled with absolutely everything it could be. Plans were ruined and in general. Was there any point in hiding in the bunker?  \n\nNevertheless, after half an hour of driving, the armored personnel carrier approached an inconspicuous hiding place somewhere in the German forests, a place for only one because of the size of the bunker and the amount of supplies there. The soldiers saluted Remer one last time as he closed the hatch behind him. He couldn't believe it, the work of his life was collapsing for the second time because of the damned Russians. When the general pulled himself together and decided to come out something shook the bunker as if a giant monster was walking through the woods from above. General Reich never found the strength to come out. \n\nAnd now he was alone in the bunker, the executioner of the German people, like Sisyphus, whose work had just been reduced to atoms. In the darkness, he was nevertheless able to light a candle on a small table and sit in a chair. Somewhere in his pocket he fumbled for a cross, there could be no better moment for it. Remer took it in his hands, folded them in a prayerful pose, and closed his eyes."

 MAR_2WRW.1978.d:0 "The Kremlin and the royal palace were empty. The King was not in Moscow or Vyatka. Only a few knew that on that sunny day, he visited his old country house near Berezniki. On the porch stood not the King-General, but a simple man, Sergey Belozyersky, who was gathering fishing gear. Wanting to spend a peaceful day in nature, he visited the lakes where he had been before, back in the days of the rupture of relations between Vyatka and Berezniki. Since then, little has changed in these woods, except for the disappearance of the hum of German bombers. Sergey put on rubber boots, waded deeper into the water, and began to fish. He forgot about his troubles and simply enjoyed the peace and beauty of nature. After a bucket full of fish, it became clear that it was getting dark. Sergey got out of the water and sat on the shore of the lake. The sunset in the woods over the water looked wonderful. Sergey was thinking about his everyday problems. About how everything could have turned out differently. About how all the people of his kingdom can now calmly meet the sunset. About how much he managed to do and how much he will still be able to do. The sun finally disappeared behind the horizon, and Sergey also decided to wrap it up. He began to climb up and...\n\n...but he couldn't. Half of his body was numb, and he fell on his side. Any attempts to scream and call for help were unsuccessful, only a hoarse whisper came out. Immediately, employees of the MGB who guarded the forest where the King was came to his aid.\n\nTwo hours later, Sergey had already been transported by helicopter to the central Ural hospital in Yekaterinburg. Five hours later, Kazem-Bek and Kosygin arrived at the hospital. At noon, despite all the help provided by the doctors, it became clear that Sergey Belozyersky had passed away."

 MAR_2WRW.1.t:0 "Germany proposes status quo"
 MAR_2WRW.1.d:0 "Despite the initial success of the operation, the pace of our offensive leaves much to be desired, the situation on the front remains difficult and continues to escalate with each passing minute. In connection with these developments, the treacherous Germans, fearing further escalation, propose that we conclude a peaceful agreement on the conditions of the status quo.\n\nDespite the outrageousness of this proposal, some individuals in our government predict the complete collapse of the front in the coming weeks. They support the decision to conclude this agreement on such contentious terms, thereby ending the war with minimal losses. But is the betrayal of the people in the Reichskommissariats worth it?"
 MAR_2WRW.1.a:0 "We could not do it, it's time to calm down."
 MAR_2WRW.1.b:0 "No 'zero' peace!"

 MAR_2WRW.2.t:0 "Germany proposes Moskovien"
 MAR_2WRW.2.d:0 "After decades, the Russian army was able to push back German forces and return to their homeland to the west of the Archangel-Astrakhan line. At the moment, we are in a winning position: the German government fears the fall of the front line, which will lead to further territorial losses for Germany. In this regard, they are ready to offer us a peace treaty, including the territory of the Reichskommissariat Moskovien.\n\nThe fact that this Reichskommissariat is unprofitable for Germany is well known, they are trying to get rid of us with minimal bloodshed. Maybe we should put a little more pressure on them?"
 MAR_2WRW.2.a:0 "Alright, that's enough for us."
 MAR_2WRW.2.b:0 "No way!"

 MAR_2WRW.3.t:0 "Germany proposes Moskovien and the Caucasus"
 MAR_2WRW.3.d:0 "Further success in our operation has put the command of Germany in an extremely difficult position. Throughout the front, there is a shortage of both manpower and equipment, incidents of clashes between troops and partisans in the rear have become more frequent. Continuing this war threatens Germany not only with the loss of several territories, but also with the destruction of the Nazi social order as a whole.\n\nOur government has been offered a project for another peace treaty. According to this, we would receive the territories of Western Russia and the lands of the Caucasus. Thus, Germany loses oil fields and other valuable resources, but is this enough compensation for years of humiliation?"
 MAR_2WRW.3.a:0 "We have fought hard, let's go home."
 MAR_2WRW.3.b:0 "No way!"
 
 MAR_2WRW.4.t:0 "Germany proposes conditional surrender"
 MAR_2WRW.4.d:0 "We have just received an urgent message from the Germans! They propose to give us Belarus and all of eastern Ukraine up to the Dnieper River in exchange for an immediate cessation of hostilities! We have ground down their main forces, which is why they are now sending fresh reserves to the front. Political upheavals are now taking place in the Reich. Some politicians in the countries occupied by the Nazis are already calling for the return of their sovereignty. We could stop now and take this victory for which we have been fighting for so many months.\n\nBut the question remains: should we sell our freedom for a piece of land? Germany offers us a small victory in exchange for a great loss of our pride and purpose. Such an offer could have serious consequences for the future of our country. We cannot risk our freedom for short-term gain. All our efforts, sacrifices, and losses were aimed at defending our homeland and sovereignty."
 MAR_2WRW.4.a:0 "We agree. Call for a conference."
 MAR_2WRW.4.b:0 "Our Russian spirit is worth much more than any territory!"

 MAR_2WRW.5.t:0 "Germany's unconditional surrender"
 MAR_2WRW.5.d:0 "We have accomplished the impossible, behind us are St. Petersburg, Moscow, Volgograd, and hundreds of other native Russian cities. We have brought long-awaited freedom to these people, while the accursed Reich suffers defeat after defeat on all parts of the front. The few surviving soldiers of the Wehrmacht are completely demoralized, in their homeland reigns true chaos.\n\nIn another burst of despair, Germany offered us an exceptional version of the peace treaty. Under it, we get the lands of all the eastern Reichskommissariats, except Poland. This is their last offer. If we continue military actions, they will end only with the complete destruction of one of us.\n\nMany military men suggest that we accept this version of the treaty, since we have already gotten what we started the war for."
 MAR_2WRW.5.a:0 "We've won! There is no point in risking any further."
 MAR_2WRW.5.b:0 "We are already close to a true victory, on to Berlin!"
 MAR_2WRW_gone_wrong_tt:0 "This §Үdecision§! will lead to §eunforeseen consequences§!"
 
 MAR_2WRW.6.t:0 "Germany's unconditional surrender"
 MAR_2WRW.6.d:0 "We did it!\n\nWho would have thought twenty years ago that the flag of the almost defunct Mladorossi movement would proudly wave over the Reichstag, the building of the world's hegemonic government? \n\nThis path was extremely difficult, and many of those who started it with us have already departed for other eternal spaces. But these trials have tempered us, and the Germans, without realizing it, forged the sword that they were eventually defeated by. Sending bombers to us in the East, they didn't even think that the war would soon come to their doorstep, and this time the aviation would come from the opposite side.\n\nWe stormed Königsberg, surrounded Leipzig. There is now not a single corner in Germany where they haven't heard of the power of the Russian army. For more than half a century, we suffered one defeat after another from Fritz: the First World War, the Great Patriotic War, the West Russian War - all these are dark pages in Russian history, but today we put an end to it once and for all. We will no longer allow the threat of fascism to grow right under our noses. \n\nThe foot of the Russian soldier crushed the heart of Nazism."
 MAR_2WRW.6.a:0 "The end of 30 years of humiliation."
 
 MAR_Collapse.1941.t:0 "Germany offers surrender"
 MAR_Collapse.1941.d:0 "Our General Staff is in a panic. The Germans broke through our pre-prepared defense lines. There can be no talk of continuing the offensive, and the front is collapsing not in our favor. Major cities are once again suffering air terror from the Luftwaffe bombers. We catastrophically overestimated our strength, and now we are again suffering defeat after defeat in Western Russia. The Germans continue to advance to the East, and we risk losing all of Western Russia. \nHowever, there is still hope for a solution. Today we received an offer of surrender from Germany, which is willing to stop military actions upon reaching the Archangel-Astrakhan line. We surrender and let them come onto the territory of A-A. \n\nOtherwise, they threaten to continue the offensive to the Urals and even organize an airborne operation in Yekaterinburg and Chelyabinsk. At the moment, we have no choice but to accept this proposal."
 MAR_Collapse.1941.a:0 "May the Motherland forgive us..."

Пока капиталистические режимы предательски прислуживали немецким захватчикам, только советский народ восстал против гнилого порядка Германии, нанося сокрушающее поражение, пнув их горящую помойку так, что она оказалась на грани политического краха. Тенденция видна любому, и если уже на второй раз ситуация так кардинально изменилась, то мы обязаны продолжить дело предков.\n\nВ третий раз Рейх должен быть уничтожен - нацизм необходимо навсегда изгнать с наших земель и дальше, из Восточной Европы, изолирован в их поганой Германии, где он сгниёт заживо. Дважды народ России проливал свою кровь, приближая этот момент, и только мы определяем то, была ли его жертва напрасна. Только переняв отцовское знамя борьбы мы изменим наш проклятый мир, сделаем их страдания не напрасными. Великая Отечественная была проиграна, Первая Западнорусская была проиграна, но лишь продолжая сражаться мы делаем все поражения временными.

Начиная революционными европейскими фракциями, желающих скинуть корпоративные режимы и установить свой контроль в образовавшемся вакууме власти, заканчивая социал-демократами, которые, по указке Америки, всё равно хотят пострелять немцев, чтобы ослабить главного конкурента на европейских рынках. Общаясь с каждой из данных организаций, временно забыв все противоречия между нашими пониманиями социализма и коммунизма, мы можем свершить даже большее - выйти через контакты левых фракций на все прочие партии, которые в их странах презирают порядок Третьего Рейха, установив корридоры для переброски всех, кто желает прекратить господство немцев, независимо от их идеологических предпочтений. Нацизм имеет множество врагов по всему миру, так как мы можем помешать множеству туристов на нашей территории вооружиться и объединиться с нашими частями, когда всё, как на зло, происходит ровно в тот момент, когда мы моргаем?"
 MAR_germans_did_that_desc:0 "Третий Рейх не сделал ничего такого, чего не свершали прочие европейские государства - это факт: англичане травили "нецивилизованные народы" газом и выстраивали концлагеря, пока французы в Африке грабили и колонизировали коренное население. Но то, что население Запада не замечало зверств своих режимов, сейчас нам даёт лишь больше простора для собственной пропаганды. Мы имеем неоспоримые факты преступлений немцев; чёрт подери, они истребляли нас, всех выживших сделали рабами, а тех, кто избежал их господства, пытали террористическими бомбардировками! Но народы самоназванного "первого мира" не знакомы ни с нашей трагедией, ни даже с теми зверствами, которые свершали они сами, являясь крайне податливой для шокирования публикой. Если мы хотим полностью уничтожить гнилой Рейх на дипломатической арене, то обязаны раскрывать всё - составить специальные группы фотовидеофиксации, которые покажут всему миру кадры того, что творили немцы с Россией. Этими фактами мы подвергнем непривычных к настоящим страданиям граждан многих стран ужасу, после чего простые люди сами начнут выходить на улицы, требуя от своих режимов прекратить контакты с немцами на любом уровне. Надо лишь суметь продемонстрировать народным массам достаточно показательные сюжеты нашей реальности, из которой мы столь решительно вырываемся."

 ###Ивенты Войны
 TaS_SWRW.1.t:0 "Army of the people, army of the freedom "
 TaS_SWRW.1.d:0 "Heinz Kessler gazed upon the crowd yet again, each time feeling his confidence in himself and his men wane. The German Free Army—a beautiful and proud name, but did the soldiers live up to it? Who among them had already been to war, and who were green recruits sent to their deaths? How many truly championed the cause of a free Germany, and how many had simply found no other way out of Russian captivity? He did not know, and he feared to find out.\n\nIn the short time the German Free Army had existed, they had tasted both sorrow and the joy of victory. Kessler's mind had long been mired in doubts, but looking at the inspired faces, he could not help but feel a surge in morale. Straightening up, the general began to speak with the full power of his lungs:\n\n"Comrades! My friends and soldiers!" "Comrades"… it seemed that was how soldiers addressed each other in Russia. "For many years, free Germans have fought against the tyrannical regime. For many years, their underground forces suffered defeat in the face of the mad Führer. But those times are behind us, for we have taken up arms in the name of freedom!"\n\nGeneral Kessler paced slowly across the pedestal where a monument once stood. It seemed that the leader of the Greater German Reich, Adolf Hitler himself, once stood here. Refocusing his gaze on the soldiers, the general continued:\n\n"Hear me, soldiers, for this war is our chance! A chance for a free Germany! A chance for a beautiful Germany! A chance for a Germany cleansed of Nazism and the legacy of Adolf Hitler! We will liberate our homeland!" With a sharp movement, Heinz turned and pointed towards the Reich. "Germans, our brothers and sisters, suffer under the yoke of the mad Führer. So come and liberate them! It is time to end the tyranny of the Third Reich and  a new, free Germany to arise!""
 TaS_SWRW.1.a:0 "Can this be called treason?"

 TaS_SWRW.2.t:0 "Explosion"
 TaS_SWRW.2.d:0 "The new oil tanker brought in from Theodorichshafen a few weeks ago amazed Michael with its appearance. He was a simple soldier from the garrison of a Black Sea port, so the enormous ship, painted in dark gray with a huge eagle on its starboard side, was awe-inspiring, even if it was just an oil tanker.\n\nAnother evening patrol in the port, another aimless walk, with hardly anyone to talk to. "Well, it's better than the frontlines," he thought at such moments. The soldier glanced at the tanker and approached the ladder leading up to it. One step, another, a third... and Michael was already on board. He had taken only a couple of tentative steps on the deck when he heard a cacophony of shouting voices behind him. The man turned around. A dozen small figures stood in the distance, shouting furiously and waving their arms. Their voices overlapped, making it difficult to understand anything. Michael was about to wave back when he made out two words that were repeated most often: "Run!" and "Jump!" He turned around in horror, toward the deck. Oh God... The deck beneath him erupted in a red-orange burst.\n\n"Pain..." was the only coherent thought pounding in his brain when he came to. It seemed the explosion had thrown him far. Opening one eye, Michael thought the world was painted in yellow and orange hues, but it was fire... just fire. His right eye couldn't see at all, and his left was partly filled with blood. Somehow finding the strength, he rolled over and began crawling along the shore. It seemed that everything was burning: the ships, the port, the buildings around him, even the water. But it didn't matter. He would survive. . .he had to. The shore was littered with stones, and each one scratched his body as he crawled over it. But his whole body was already in pain — what difference did it make?\n\nAnother meter behind him. Just a little more, and he would be free. He would get out and go home. Cursing in a quiet, raspy voice, Michael tried to stand up. To no avail. He didn't even have the strength to lift his body. Michael rolled over and looked at the moon, then down at his legs. Where his legs should have been. He stared blankly at the spot, and it took him a dozen seconds to realize that his legs were gone — just two bloody stumps covered with charred crust. Michael looked back at the moon.\n\n"Beautiful," he murmured."

 TaS_GERCollapse_news.1.d:0 "Predictable news comes from the Volkshalle. During an emergency session of the congress addressing the recent defeat, the Greater German Reich discussed urgent measures for post-war recovery. A significant portion of the session focused on the need to identify all traitors whose actions led to the defeat in the Second West Russian War. The ongoing investigation has already identified numerous suspects, and [GER.GetLeader] publicly disclosed their names in his speech.\n\nDespite the Führer's status, the political authority of the German leader has been significantly undermined recently, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among various factions. As a result, the planned arrests were canceled. Only the actions of the session's security managed to restore order among the tumultuous assembly members, who were on the verge of physical altercations. The Reichstag failed to reach a consensus, and the session was prematurely adjourned."

Великогерманское Вещание объявило о быстрой и безболезненной смерти лидера от сердечной атаки вследствии сильного стресса за недавнее поражение, однако официальная позиция государства многими подвергается сомнению: врачебные комиссии прочих стран по доступным для общественности фото и видеоматериалам предполагают о давно прогрессирующей болезни, хоть и затрудняются дать конкретный диагноз лишь по визуальным данным.\n\nПравительство Рейха постановило о траурном дне для прощания с лидером всех немцев, а также о переносе второго экстренного заседания на более близкую дату для назначения нового Фюрера арийской нации. Множество граждан надеется, что новый лидер сможет преодолеть нарастающий кризис, но лишь время покажет, так ли это."

Получая в руки разбитую Германию с потерянными колониями, уничтоженной армией, надорванной индустрией и уничтоженным дипломатическим влиянием. Вся экономика Рейха была выстроена на эксплуатации колоний, и никто не знает, как возможно её перестроить в кратчайшие сроки, но Клопфер в своём вступительном обращении заверил, что сможет сдержать чёрную спираль падения Рейха.\n\nНе смотря на это, многие иностранные экономисты и политологи говорят о невозможности сдерживания каскадного нарастания проблем для немецкой нации и предсказывают, что потребуются многие годы на восстановление прежней мощи Великогерманского Рейха, сходясь в одном - время старого порядка уходит, и Россия занимает освободившееся место европейского гегемона.

Силовые органы Рейха пока сдерживает недовольство.\n\nНо, во время прогулки, был убит глава Абвера - Рейнхард Гелен, когда неизвестный гражданский из толпы смог сделать выстрел из пистолета калибра девять миллиметров. Охрана не смогла задержать стрелка, потеряв след, когда он прыгнул в реку Шпре, но уже составлено множество версий начиная с попыток нового Фюрера Клопфера избавиться от своих противников и заканчивая действиями набирающей всё больше людей в свои ряды RAF по дезорганизации силовой машины государства.

Некогда разбитая и ушедшая в подполье RAF вернулась обратно на свет и смогла оседлать недовольство толпы, набирая в свои ряды с каждым днём всё больше людей, а акции перерастают из стихийных погромов в организованные теракты.\n\nКлопфер уже объявил чрезвычайное положение в крупных городах, а к борьбе с восставшей группировкой присоединились Гестапо и всё ещё страдающий от последствий своего обезглавливания Абвер. Однако, вооружённые группировки уже после этого произвели атаки на ряд административных и полицейских учреждений, так что вряд-ли эта проблема будет решена достаточно оперативно."

An unidentified ballistic missile was shot down over the town of Höfn. According to reports, although the missile was promptly neutralized by air defense systems, its debris still damaged the town hall and caused a fire in the building. Currently, one death and several injuries have been reported, with first responders working at the crash site.\n\nPreliminary analysis of the debris suggests they are likely remains of a V-2 rocket. The Icelandic government has demanded an explanation from the Third Reich's officials, but the embassy and authorities remain silent. It seems that even after the end of the Second West Russian War, the shadow of global conflict continues to loom over the world."
