  ###KOSYGIN WILDRIDE STARTS HERE###
 MAR_kosprot_Century_decieve:0 "Deception of the Century"
 MAR_kosprot_Century_decieve_desc:0 "Incredible, but people managed to believe that Alexei Kosygin is actually the miraculously surviving Alexei Nikolaevich, son of Nicholas II. What we have done can be compared to the greatest deception in the history of Russia, if not in the history of mankind. Even the numerous False Dmitris did not receive such recognition and popularity as we did.\n\nAfter such an unexpected victory, the newly crowned Romanov will need to \"regroup\" and start thinking about further actions. But first, he needs to talk to Kazem-bek..."
 MAR_Kosygin.1.t:0 "Debtor"
 MAR_Kosygin.1.d:0 "Alexei Kosygin, now Romanov, and Alexander Kazem-bek were sitting in the lounge. Kazem-bek and Alexei Romanov talked about many things - about life, history, but eventually the conversation turned to the recent victory at the Zemsky Sobor. Of course, it was an unexpected event for all the people of Western Russia.\n\nAs soon as the conversation turned to the role of the victory in the Sobor, Alexei Romanov ordered the servants to leave the room. As soon as the door closed, Kosygin and Kazem-bek began talking about the recent victory.\n\n- You really came up with everything cleverly, I didn't even understand it at first, well done - said Kazem-bek, - but don't forget about urgent problems. I don't know how you pulled it off, but God be with you, history is written by the victors.\n\n- Yes, I remember - said Alexei Romanov calmly, clearly sensing the dissatisfied tone in Alexander's speech - but it was the people who decided to elect me. I don't think I won solely because of the legend, rather because they wanted to see a stable and fair Russia. Although who knows?\n\n- Here's what I can tell you. Although I'm the prime minister, you should remember who you owe this to. You haven't forgotten who you really are, have you?\n\n- Why did you change your tone of communication to such a rude one? Why are you so worried? - Romanov asked.\n\n- Because your victory complicates everything in our business. If the people find out the truth or stop believing in you, which is quite possible, your power will collapse. The Mladorossi case will be at risk of failure.\n\n- The power will not be shaken if the people are well-fed and satisfied.\n\n- Still, I would recommend listening to me and doing everything I say, otherwise... there will be unpleasant consequences.\n\nAfter such an obvious threat from Kazem-bek, Alexei turned his gaze to the aquarium, where he saw swimming fish - one was smaller than the other. After that, he looked at Alexander and nodded silently."

 MAR_Kosygin.2.t:0 "Unexpected report"
 MAR_Kosygin.2.d:0 "Belozersky received a report from the Perm local garrison through his aide that certain people broke into the weapons depot and stole some weapons. With every new line, Sergey read faster and faster until he reached the end of the report, where everything was already clear: the weapons disappeared without a trace, and those who robbed the depot have not yet been found or even suspected.\n\nBelozersky could never have imagined that someone would do such a thing on the territory of a unified West Russia. Order was restored, but apparently not everywhere. Belozersky thinks that this is only typical for this area. But why Perm? Supporters of Gutrum Wagner haven't been seen since we liberated the city from the Aryan Brotherhood. This is a mystery that needs to be solved.\n\nSergey Belozersky gave orders to his aide to come to Vladimir Gil, one of the experienced officers who can figure out this incident. Gil almost immediately comes to Sergey's office on the same day. When he entered the office, Sergey began the conversation:\n\n- Gil, the situation, I'll put it this way, is somewhat unusual, - Belozersky began to speak, clearly trying to formulate his thought, - and I think you should familiarize yourself with this report.\n\nTaking the report in his hands, Gil began to read, and during this time, Belozersky continued to speak.\n\n- I believe that only you can deal with this issue. Everyone else is either busy or on vacation.\n\n- I can handle this task, and I'm ready to start working immediately. I'll select the best people for this assignment.\n\n- That's great. You're free to go. - Sergey Belozersky said the last phrase clearly with some relief.\n\n- Understood. - After that, Gil left the office."

And it is there that we must visit our \"friends\" to \"explain nicely\" to them. After all, the Tsar cannot lie, he is accountable to God himself, isn't he?"

When asked if they knew about the activities of other dissidents, they gave different answers, the general answer of which boils down to "NO." There is suspicion that they are deliberately lying.\n\nAll 102 dissidents have been sent to prison cells.\n\nSome of the raids that took place at that time were in places where no underground activity was detected. Apparently, our operatives attacked false leads and received false information about the location of underground cells.\n\nAfter the operation, we find that underground activity has not been completely eradicated, and propaganda to blacken ALEKSEY II ROMANOV continues in a smaller volume."

 MAR_Kosygin.4.d:0 "Sergei Taboritsky and his loyal group of people are laying low. They have established the \"Throne\" and are seriously opposing Alexei II Romanov, considering him to be similar to False Dmitry. These people hate this pretender, know who he really is, and dream of eradicating this injustice, preparing Russia for the real coming of Alexei.\n\n\"False Alexei False Romanov,\" Taboritsky began. \"This is Alexei Kosygin. He is nothing but a pathetic son of a lathe worker who rose in the Judeo-Bolshevik Union of Bukharin only because Kosygin himself was a Jew. The fact that he is a Jew gives us reason to kill him, and we will soon be able to do so.\n\n\"No one is arguing with you,\" said Evtukhovich. \"But we are still weak, we have few true Russians ready to save our homeland to strike this Judeo-mimicry under the real God-chosen Russia.\"\n\n\"We, the 'Throne-seekers,' have many supporters. Even those who do not openly support our views share them - Alexei Romanov is not who he claims to be. We must do this because Kosygin will lead the country to its national ruin!\"\n\n\"My people report,\" interrupted Andrei Dikiy, \"that Kosygin's people recently dealt a serious blow to our underground cells. We lost many of our supporters, but some of them are still intact and continue to spread the truth.\"\n\n\"Excellent...only an idea can defeat an idea. And on our side is the truth of the Lord and the true Alexei Romanov,\" said Sergei Taboritsky with a satisfied tone.\n\n\"I would like to add,\" Victor Laryonov began, \"that my people, former members of the Aryan Brotherhood, were able to penetrate the territory of the armory and take with them enough weapons. This will only help us.\"\n\n\"Wonderful. This all indicates that we have successes. Even where we yield to the enemy in everything, they are weak in another - they are weak in spirit, and they will not have the courage to touch us. They are weak, and we will kill them all - Kosygin, Kazem-Bek, Belozersky, all of them will die in the name of Great Russia!\" Taboritsky concluded."

 MAR_Kosygin.5.d:0 "Alexei Kosygin-Romanov is trying to gather his thoughts in order to start working. However, remembering Taboritsky, all his thoughts are lost at once. This person is not very pleasant by himself, and negative energy directed towards Kosygin could be felt from him. Was it about the alleged miraculous survival of Nicholas II's son? Or just personal dislike? It's driving him crazy. Suddenly, one of Alexei's thoughts managed to formulate into a clear question - where is Taboritsky? Nothing has been heard about him since the Komi Republic ceased to exist as a separate state, and now it is unclear where he is - either hiding or dead, or something else.\n\nRemembering the reports of his subordinates - from Belozersky, from internal security, he found a certain connection here - all of this may be the work of Sergey Taboritsky himself. However, how can this be checked and confirmed? Maybe it's not related at all? And yet, something needs to be done about it. He needs to talk about all this with Kazem-bek, and Alexei Kosygin-Romanov made this attempt.\n\nTrying to explain his position, Alexander just smirked. \"Have you lost your mind? We expected some kind of mess to happen on our country's territory. There's nothing to worry about,\" said Kazem-bek. \"We'll deal with all of this soon. These are just temporary difficulties, and for now, we have more important goals. We'll soon gather the first council, which will solve our main problems. For now, I have to continue working on improving the country's management.\""

Belozersky's sense of danger did not dull even for a minute when there was nothing more dangerous than a dinner knife around.

However, the arrival of the country's top officials is still a long way off, so for now, it is necessary to inspect the premises and prepare it for the meeting. Check the lighting, air ventilation, clean all the dust that has probably been there since the last battles for Vyatka. The paintings that decorate the building depict people from the State Duma, and the main and largest painting is Ilya Repin's artwork, \"The Solemn Meeting of the State Council on May 7, 1901\".\n\nPreparation for the event includes not only checking the banal lighting and others, but also organizing meals and breaks, so places for the canteen need to be prepared. In addition - furniture needs to be brought in, on which our officials will work. Chairs - they are also needed, especially many of them for conducting meetings. In general, everything necessary must be brought in and furniture arranged in such a way that everyone has a place.\n\nIt is also necessary to bring security to this place. But this task will be carried out by the captain of one of the local garrison units. They must be dressed in ceremonial uniform and will be located outside and inside the premises. Additional precautions will never hurt.\n\nThere is still a lot of time before the congress begins. The preparation is in full swing."

 MAR_Kosygin.8.t:0 "Found Clue"
 MAR_Kosygin.8.d:0 "Gil, selecting the best of his men from the Ministry of Internal Security, immediately began carrying out his task from Belozersky. Upon learning that Sergei would not be in contact in the near future, apparently due to the upcoming Vyatka Congress, Gil had to act almost alone, but at the same time he was given carte blanche for practically any actions. \n\nVladimir Gil sat in his headquarters, watching the map with conditional designations where his squads were located in certain places. Suddenly, a group of operatives came to his headquarters with a suspicious guest. \n\n"Comrade commander, may I report?" began the subordinate. \n\n"Report," said Vladimir Gil dryly. \n\n"We found this man by his tracks and with the help of dogs. Our searches led to this man, who is likely the same thief who raided that warehouse. He was armed and there were still five more people with him. The others ran away, but we caught and tied him up." \n\n"Well, well," Vladimir Gil said in amazement. After that, the commander began to examine this strange man, who was dressed in very simple clothing for the area: pants, a shirt, dirty boots, and a face with incorrect features that was clearly evil. By feeling, it can be assumed that this is the same person who raided the warehouse, as he has no sense of innocence based on his face. After this inspection, Gil issued the following command: "Will you find the others?" \n\n"Exactly." \n\n"For now, I ask you to send him to the interrogation room. Inform the other squads to continue the search for the bandits." \n\n"Understood, it will be done." \n\nVladimir Gil and his men sent this suspect to the interrogation room. Gil decided to conduct the interrogation himself. \n\n"Tell me your name," Vladimir Gil began. \n\n"I don't want to talk," the stranger said in a slightly hoarse voice. \n\n"Say your name!" Gil said loudly in response to such a bold answer. \n\nThe stranger tried to spit in Gil's face, but he hit him in the chest. Gil immediately swung his fist and hit the man in the face. The blow was so strong that you could even hear the neck crack, but it did not break the spine. Soon, blood flowed from the stranger's tooth. \n\nTrying to say something, this stranger, trying to endure the pain, clearly stated his name and surname: "Leonid Brown... Leonid Brown!" \n\nThe interrogation continues."

 MAR_Kosygin.9.t:0 "Slaughter Plan"
 MAR_Kosygin.9.d:0 "Taborytsky was extremely pleased that a sufficient number of dissatisfied people with the results of the Zemsky Sobor had joined his organization "The Throne". His organization included everyone who could: monarchists of Taborytsky, "passionaries", Aryans, and even Vlasovites and ordinary citizens who were extremely dissatisfied with the current regime. Simple terrorists are also part of this organization. In general, if not all, then the main mass of those who were simply negatively disposed towards the authorities.\n\nThere were many people, and there were also material resources. The idea - the main component of this organization - was also strong. In any case, it suited many. Taborytsky felt real power in his hands, which was felt in his vivacity. His wandering eyes eagerly looked at the map of Western Russia, as if he wanted to study it as quickly as possible and remember everything in the slightest detail, but in fact he just wanted to understand where and what forces were under his control.\n\nAs soon as he learned that the Mladorossi Congress would be held in Vyatka, he realized - there was no more time to delay. It is necessary to declare oneself as a real force that is capable of overthrowing the Judeo-Bolsheviks Kosygin, Kazem-bek, Belozersky and all their top. It is time for real actions, and therefore Sergey Taborytsky called to himself all his main top, which has threads almost throughout Russia.\n\n"My friends," Taborytsky began, "we will soon strike a crushing blow to the Judeo-Bolshevism, which has crept up to us under the guise of true monarchy with the face of Alexei Nikolaevich himself! We can no longer delay, their congress will begin soon, which they will not have time to start - we will kill them faster than they will finish their speech!\n\nWe will strike such a blow with one blow, thanks to which Russia will only be grateful to us. We could not completely remove the tumor of Judeo-Bolshevism. Now this tumor has grown again and is now sucking all the vital forces out of Russia. Now, when we have this opportunity, the Lord God has given us this opportunity, and we have no right to ignore it!\n\nI order you, on behalf of the real and living Alexei Romanov and in the name of God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, to begin preparations for the murder of this Judeo-Bolshevik! And then all of Russia will be free from the slavery of communism."

 MAR_Kosygin.10.d:0 "Belozersky, Kazem-bek, and Alexei Kosygin-Romanov were driving in a special car towards the building where the congress was being held. On both sides of the road stood numerous guards dressed in parade uniforms, who acted as a living fence separating the road from the crowd of people waiting to hear the announcement of the start of the Vyatka congress. Agitation and propaganda in the newspapers created a sufficient information flow for the population to be fully aware of the upcoming event and understand how important it was. In addition, the population had a generally positive perception of the Mladorossi, so not only did they come to the rally to honor Kazem-bek and the others, but they also sincerely rejoiced in their arrival.\n\nIn the building itself, prominent party leaders were already gathering and waiting for the start of the congress. It only remained to wait for Alexei II Kosygin-Romanov to announce it. Many were already eager to get to work, and some had even started working before the appointed time, discussing with other party members the problems in the country - problems in the economy, politics, society...\n\nThe car stopped in front of the entrance to the building with its side doors facing the entrance. Kazem-bek was the first to step out of the front door, and the crowd immediately rejoiced at his appearance. The second to come out was Sergei Belozersky, who was also showered with joyful cries. The third was Kosygin-Romanov, whose cries of joy at his appearance were perhaps the loudest. Kosygin stopped briefly to look at this huge crowd, which had numerous banners, portraits of Alexei Romanov, and other items clearly aimed at supporting him. For a moment, Alexei Kosygin-Romanov even calmed down and began to ascend with Kazem-bek and Belozersky.\n\nAs they reached the top, they stepped onto the pedestal where tables with microphones had been prepared for the speakers. Kazem-bek and Belozersky were the first to speak, with Kosygin-Romanov sitting behind them. The speeches of these two leaders began, and Kosygin-Romanov simply sat and waited until they finished their main part. At this time, the cries of joy subsided, and it became even too quiet for such a spacious place packed with people. Kosygin felt that something was wrong here..."

 MAR_Kosygin.11.d:0 "15 minutes have already passed since Vladimir Gil started interrogating this stranger who introduced himself as Leonid Braun. As it turned out during the torture - Braun is called that because he belongs to the remnants of the Aryan Brotherhood organization, and it was he who stole the weapons in Perm. Are there still Aryans left? Apparently so. During that time, his face became battered everywhere, starting from broken lips and eyebrows, ending even with knocked-out teeth of this pseudo-Aryan.\n\n- You kn-know, Com-man-nder, - Leonid Braun began to speak, as if wanting to tease this man, - you kn-know how to treat women.\n\nAfter that, Gil hit this man once again with such force that he flew along with the chair for 1 meter, and he fell on the cold, but blood-soaked floor. However, this did not stop Vladimir Gil, and he began to kick this man, first in the head, breaking his nose, and then in the stomach. Blood flowed from his nose again. How has he not lost consciousness yet?\n\nAfter a series of such brutal blows, Vladimir Gil grabbed this man, who was already moaning in pain, trying to breathe through his bleeding nose, by the collar and sat him back on the chair.\n\n- WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?! - Gil asked a very simple and direct question.\n\n- On the "Throne"... - the prisoner barely answered.\n\n- WHO IS THERE?!\n\n- Taboritsky... Sergei Taboritsky.\n\nAfter this phrase, Vladimir's anger began to subside, he began to calm down.\n\n- What is the goal of the organization?!\n\n- To kill all of you!..\n\n- What else will you say?\n\nLeonid was completely broken morally and physically, so he began to say everything he needed.\n\n- Our people were preparing an explosion in Vyatka. Right now, you have a congress there, and we will kill all of you.\n\n- How many of you are in Vyatka?!\n\n- Many. The city will be captured by us, dirty Rus...\n\nWithout finishing this phrase, Gil hit him again, but already clearly with half of his strength, in the face of this Leonid. Pieces of blood spewed from his mouth, splashing on the floor.\n\nGil decided to sit down himself to think over everything he heard. There is currently no connection with Belozersky, but urgent actions need to be taken. Gil decided to act purely on his own discretion.\n\n- I have nothing more to talk with you. - Vladimir said in conclusion.\n\n- Y-yes? Oh, do you want to let me go...?\n\nVladimir took out his gun from his holster, brought it into a loaded state, and aimed it at Leonid.\n\n- To forgive... To forget... You wanted me... To forgive, right? - Leonid began to speak immediately in a more lively tone. - Please, don't kill me... I swear...\n\nBefore he finished his sentence, Gil shot Leonid in the head, ending his suffering. Blood splatters and pieces of brain scattered towards the wall, where it all printed.\n\nVladimir Gil left the interrogation room and said to his operative:\n\n- Urgently call the nearest division from Vyatka. Any, just something! Transmit the order: move urgently to Vyatka to establish order in the city! This is not a drill!\n\n- Sir, yes sir! - Said the operative quickly and prepared to run toward the phone, when suddenly Gil interrupted him:"

And everything would have been fine, but today they intend to spoil the holiday for the people.\n\nA few days before all this, at night, the Taborytsy assault group, who belong to the organization "Principle," installed mines that will only be triggered by remote control. They don't require a cord, but they are very powerful and reliable enough to guarantee the destruction of the intended target. At the same time, they are expensive - so the "Principles" have only one chance to guarantee the killing of all the top Mladorossi.\n\nThe "Principles" have taken their positions. The Taborytsy are extremely determined about their plans - they intend to seize the entire city, just to prevent Kosygin, Belozersky, and Kazem-Bek from escaping the city. Therefore, there are approximately twice as many Taborytsy in black uniforms in the city as there are garrison troops. Everyone is confident of their victory, and there is nothing that could go wrong.\n\n"Resistance is expected - it is inevitable. But even if we die and kill the Mladorossi - it will already save Russia from Judeo-Bolshevism," thought the person who was upstairs in the building.\n\nIn the hands of one of the Taborytsy assault group members, namely Andrey Karachev, is a detonator that will have to go off in order to blow up everyone who is currently standing on the podium. Whether a person will live or die depends on his actions. There is nothing that could save them now. All that remains is to wait for the order to start the operation...\n\n"Valkyrie-1, this is Eagle-2, do you copy?" began the Taborytsy assault group member over the portable radio.\n\n"Eagle-2, this is Valkyrie-1, we hear you loud and clear. All targets have arrived at the assembly point. Are your people in position?"\n\n"Affirmative. They are ready to start the operation at any moment."\n\n"Great. Begin the operation right now.

Not losing consciousness yet, he heard the crowd screaming in shock at what had happened. But what happened just now? Kosygin could no longer understand. Losing consciousness immediately, the guards quickly and decisively rushed to save those who could still be saved. Finding the bodies of Kazem-Bek and Belozersky, the guards, after a brief hesitation, decided to take them back too. These bodies were hit by multiple fragments, part of a leg was missing, and some of the fragments hit the skull. How did Kosygin not get hit? This can only be explained by a miracle.\n\nThe crowd immediately started dispersing, like ants running in different directions across the square. Hidden "Prestol" squads armed with automatic weapons emerged from cover, attacking scattered small groups of guards. Trying to organize defense, the main defense was built around the Congress building. As heard from the radio, the defense was also arranged along the main streets, managing to occupy residential buildings. Taborytsky's assault troops killed not only Mladoross soldiers but also civilians, as they did not see any difference between them.\n\nKosygin was laid on a couch deep inside the building, where there was no chance of catching him while the defenders fought with their last strength. Reports came in that ammunition was running out and they had to pick it up from dead assault troops. The situation was extremely difficult...\n\nKosygin regained consciousness on the couch and heard gunfire all over the city. Listening to the battle, he heard tanks and armored vehicles rumbling in the background. This was Gilya's reinforcement. In a few hours, the resistance of the "Prestolniks" will be suppressed.

 MAR_Kosygin.14.d:0 "Kosygin walked around the building where the meeting was supposed to take place. He saw dozens of injured security guards who defended this building from the \"prestolniki.\" Drops of blood were everywhere, wherever he looked. The soldiers' moans from their wounds evoked strong pity from Kosygin, but he could do little to help them. He did not know what had happened to Kazem-bek and Belozersky, and he wanted to find them.\n\nAnd he found them. Dead. Two almost disfigured bodies had glassy eyes, pale skin, and blood that was flowing around them. Kosygin, who previously looked at all this matter with some disdain, looked at the bodies of his former comrades with mixed feelings. Either he was extremely uncomfortable looking at it, or he was even glad that there was no longer anyone who could threaten him with their demands, or he felt that he could now cry from the loss of his close people. Finally, the last wave of emotions flooded over him - hatred and a thirst for revenge. He perfectly understood who did it. We survived this day, and now a countermove is needed. Kosygin swore to them, at least mentally, that they would be avenged at all costs.\n\nMeanwhile, after a short mourning for their fallen comrades, Kosygin walked out into the street and saw a terrible picture: as it turned out, the pedestal, the place where the speech was taking place, was blown up, and there were dead civilians on the street, many of whom were still alive but barely moving. Kosygin immediately recognized the characteristic uniform of Taboritsky's stormtroopers, and he understood that it was his doing. Everything was just as he had expected - Taboritsky did not forget about him and would not leave him alone until he killed Alexei Kosygin-Romanov.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Vladimir Gil arrived in his armored personnel carrier.

The description of this order suggests that in the event of a war, this plant would have to be reoriented to produce cartridges and any other military products that could be adapted at this plant. \n\nThe factory manager was not shocked, but he was very surprised by such an order. The only question that bothered him was how he was supposed to reorient this pasta factory to produce the same cartridges. How? It turned out that the instructions for action were written below and indicated the documents that would also need to be consulted.

Glushkov explained the brief principle of the operation of the entire system, what would be connected to it, what would be transmitted, and so on. Kitov, on the other hand, explained the effects of what would happen if we invest a lot of money and effort in implementing this project. \n\nAt the end of the presentation, Maslennikov and Kosygin-Romanov looked at this project with obvious amazement. The most important thing here is that this project is extremely promising for the future - it will help to solve the problem of bureaucratic red tape in the future, even at the embryonic stage, and immediately it will give a strong impetus to the development of science and the effectiveness of administrative management, which is so desirable to obtain right now. \n\n"How much will this whole project cost us?"

But to grow economically, he needs to have "Sam-4", that is, to get 4 similar buckets from 1 bucket of sown grain. In this case, he could sell the surplus on the external market and benefit from it. However, in our case, Ivan could not achieve "Sam-4", only "Sam-3", so he needs to cover the expenses for sowing his new crop. And for these purposes, he travels to the city on horseback. \n\nUpon arriving at the special money distribution point, he provided all the necessary information to receive the money, and he indicated the size of his field. Based on these calculations, he was given exactly enough money to cover these sowing expenses. Now he has free money to spend on something other than fertilizers and other sowing needs.

It is important for us to not only obtain military and political support, but also to establish trade relations with any of the parties. If our leadership announces that we should cooperate, for example, with Japan, then we should direct all our efforts towards cooperation with them. \n\nAnd besides that, - Demichev continued, - we should establish some kind of relationship with other countries, primarily with third world countries, so that we have a serious weight in world politics and defend our interests in all corners of the globe. - Demichev finished with his phrase. - Any questions?"

 MAR_kosfor_two_polars_desc: "It's time to choose which side of the Cold War we will pay attention to first. The choice of supporting one or the other side may determine the fate of the rest of the world, and therefore, we should think not only about the advantages we will get right now but also about the future that will inevitably come soon. \n\nBefore Tsar Alexey II Romanov makes his final decision and tells Demichev what to do, he has to sort out all the pros and cons of each country we are dealing with."

 MAR_Kosygin.29.t: "Analysis"
 MAR_Kosygin.29.d: "Alexei Romanov was still contemplating which country to choose as the main economic partner. Obviously, each country has its own advantages and disadvantages, and they sometimes manifest themselves sharply in comparison. However, overall they were, as strange as it may seem, quite equivalent. \n\nFirst of all, if we look to the West, the United States of America would seem like a very good option. They have a strong army, one of the most powerful economies in the world, and, in general, it is practically a consumer paradise, with a huge variety of different products to suit any taste. If we pay attention, many countries trade with the United States, so they have almost everything that is possible to offer, and it would be good for the people to import some consumer goods, at least initially, to improve their standard of living. \n\nOn the other hand, if we look to the East, where the sun rises, there is an equally good option - Japan. Japan does not have such a strong economy or army, but their technology is almost legendary (at least as Kosygin knows it). Their industrial technologies and electronics, they say, surpass those of the Americans, and because of this, they are trying to catch up and surpass them in economic terms. Thanks to borrowing their technology, we can catch up and surpass everyone else in economic terms ourselves."

This means that we are starting to get closer to the West and we will reap great economic benefits from this. Of course, we will lose some technological advantages over the rest of the world by not choosing Japan's side, but we will compensate for this by having a huge variety of consumer goods available to the people. \n\nAll that remains is to open the embassy there. Demichev will send his ambassadors as soon as the Tsar gives the order."

So now Peter needed to prepare his envoys to send them to the US. \n\nA whole delegation set off a week later to the US on a long-range plane across the Atlantic Ocean. The flight, which lasted about 10 hours, was difficult for the envoys, nevertheless, they managed to reach Washington, where people were already waiting for them to accompany our diplomats to the White House. \n\nThe President, as well as some US ministers, began discussions with our envoys, where lengthy negotiations began. The main essence of these discussions was to provide general information about the West-Russian People's Principality and to talk about their intentions. They were generally friendly towards the United States of America according to the President, and therefore the negotiations were not very difficult, but separate complications arose in matters concerning Europe. The President and the ministers dodged direct questions about this region with all kinds of truths and lies. \n\nIn the end, the firm outcome of this small conference was the decision to open an official embassy of the ZRNP in Washington. This is a huge success, especially considering that the country was recently divided into many small pseudo-states and was recovering economically for a long time."

Penicillin, which was needed in large quantities, was also here. Bandages, cotton pads, cotton itself, tourniquets, syringes, antibiotics, and a whole list of different medicines that a person needs when ill. \n\nOf course, in the territory of the West Russian People's Principality, these and many other medicines are available even without any foreign aid, but they are not produced as much as needed, and until their own production can be established, the assistance of those who have these medicines should be utilized.

The biggest difficulty was the language barrier - the gap between the Russian and Japanese languages was overcome with some difficulty, if it were not for the help of translators. The main essence of these discussions was to provide general information about the Western Russian People's Principality and to explain our intentions. They were generally quite friendly towards the Japanese Empire, according to the Prime Minister, and therefore the negotiations were not too difficult, but individual complications arose in questions regarding the Far East. The Prime Minister and officials evaded direct questions about this region by any means necessary. \n\nIn the end, the firm decision of this small conference was to open an official embassy of the WRP in Tokyo.

 MAR_Kosygin.33.d: "Japanese sellers and entrepreneurs were clearly interested in flooding foreign markets with their goods. These markets were necessary for Japan to enrich itself by selling its own products in other countries, so the Japanese were pleased to hear the proposal from our delegation to inspect various scientific achievements of Japan. \n\nA whole excursion program was organized for the envoys from Western Russia to please them and to see a huge range of different things that are so necessary for the People's Principality. Here, everything - from tape recorders, televisions, refrigerators, to robots. By the way, the latter interested the envoys in particular. Therefore, the envoys were more interested in buying these robots and, in general, signing a trade proposal where these robots could be supplied to Russia for good money. \n\nDespite all the attempts by the Japanese to please and sell more goods, unfortunately, they failed. The envoys were uncompromising in their desires and did not intend to take anything extra to their homeland. Despite the fact that the envoys traveled, in essence, throughout Tokyo, ate a lot of good food, and saw a lot of technology, they did not deviate from their desire to buy specifically industrial robots.

Therefore, it will be extremely beneficial, if not necessary, for us to have a huge market in Asia that could buy our goods in the volumes we can only dream of. \n\nBy reselling goods, or for example, producing better quality products using new robots and selling this very same product, we make the lives of Indians much better than before, and our economy will benefit greatly from this."

There are so many workers that if there were industry in the country, the cost of labor would be about the same as the cost of labor in China. And we haven't even mentioned that India could produce as much as possibly a third of the world's production. \n\nWhile there is no industry in India, they need consumer goods.

Obviously, their pseudo-leaders also consider us as opponents, and most likely they will try to destroy us. At least, they have not shown any signs of wanting peaceful negotiations.

They are to begin destabilizing the situation in Western Siberia. They are skilled operatives who can spread propaganda and thereby undermine the stability of the state and the fighting spirit of enemy soldiers. Propaganda and agitation are weapons of mass destruction in which the appearance of the first negative symptoms in the enemy is comparable to the speed of a turtle, while its destructive effect is comparable only to nuclear bombs. Words can inflict damage that bombings cannot. \n\nThe KGB unit 'Gamma' is already infiltrating the territory of Western Siberia, making their way through the forests and taking cover, and then moving on to the populated areas where they will begin their activities, hiding among the people.

As a result of the presence of nuclear weapons on all three sides of the conflict, direct war is impossible, but there are regional conflicts in the world, usually civil wars or wars of a local nature, such as in the recent South African War, where there were clashes of interests between the US and Germany. \n\nOur country must defend its interests wherever possible. The West Russian People's Principality has already managed to establish itself as a real force, but we have little influence in this world. In this case, we must win our influence in this world by helping regimes that will be loyal to us in civil wars or in direct conflicts between two regional countries. In this difficult task, the Tsarist Legions must help us, which will be staffed similar to the French Foreign Legion and used abroad as volunteers."

This caveat is that every such person will be loyal to our state and the Tsar. However, it is evident that there will be few such minorities in this legion, and the overwhelming majority of soldiers are Russians who have joined the service in this legion. \n\nDirect agitation in favor of joining the Tsar's legion is going on in the newspapers. Giving many promises like "You will see the world", "You will protect your country", and so on, you could see some falsehood in it. Behind the good intentions in the style of "We will protect the poor and the needy," it feels like the country simply needs people who could fight for its geopolitical interests. The only thing that was attractive was the huge salary of service, after which one could live without problems for a long time. And in any case, the possibility of visiting various regions of the world - in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, America - was also attractive."

This and much more causes huge problems in these countries, sometimes leading to civil wars. \n\nWhere there is war, there is a need for weapons. We could derive a certain benefit from this by selling weapons to Africans, just as Zlatoust once sold weapons to pseudo-rulers of Russia.

But not the inspector, who saw real money behind these checkmarks and numbers, which could be obtained from the sale of weapons. \n\nDid he think about where and to whom these rifles would specifically end up? Maybe to another African country that couldn't share something with its neighbor? Or maybe to the rebels of the African Shield or any other country that wants to overthrow its ruler?

We believe that cooperation, or rather Russian interests in economic and political cooperation with other states, is not a bad thing. Look at the United States, Germany, or Japan—they also have their interests in cooperation, and can their interests be called imperialistic? No. Therefore, our interests are the same. \n\nWe may be accused of sponsoring destabilization in regions and pro-Russian political groups around the world. And here they may again discover that other countries are doing the same thing— the United States and Germany, clearly or indirectly, intervened in the recent conflict in South Africa, and someone directly sponsored any group in a civil war in any other country. Is that bad? From a geopolitical point of view, it's only good. \n\nIn this cruel world, we cannot afford to be toothless. The more resolute and 'toothier' one is, the more one can defend one's interests in geopolitics. Pacifism and peacefulness in this world, if they are welcome at all, are only formal.

Enough time had passed to make at least a subjective assessment of the events that had taken place earlier, and, to be honest, there was a lot to remember. \n\nHe remembered how he became a member of the Mladorossi party and asked Kazem-Bek to become the next candidate at the Zemsky Sobor. It's surprising that people seriously thought he was the surviving Alexei Romanov. What was it really like? What was going on in the minds of ordinary citizens who voted for Alexei Romanov, who was just a mask for a man named Alexei Kosygin? Maybe they just wanted to see Kosygin himself? It's striking that although he did a lot to win, it wasn't really part of the plan. Rather, it was, but Kosygin himself thought about it the least. He expected to become the Minister of Economy under Belozersky or Kazem-Bek, but instead he became a full-fledged Tsar. \n\nThe Viatka Conference dramatically turned the fate of the whole country. And it turned events not because it was held, but because it was foiled by the "Throne". It's only possible to marvel at the scale of the opposition in the country and the fact that this conspiracy was almost all-encompassing. Taboritsky was truly a crazy man, and it seems that Kosygin understands why they followed him. They followed him simply because he was a figure that united all the radical opposition. It's frightening to imagine what would have happened to the West Russian People's Principality if his people had achieved their goals. What specific goals? We cannot know exactly, and perhaps that is for the best. Taboritsky is dead, and therefore there is no point in worrying about them anymore. \n\nSuch dramatically turned events in the country had a good impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. It can be said with certainty that people are living better and better. The economy is growing by leaps and bounds, which was not the case under Bukharin. Probably the same could be said if Kazem-Bek were in power as the regent of Maria and Tsar Belozersky. But they died, and in the absence of other options, Kosygin, and now Romanov, became the head of this country. \n\nRomanov thought for a long time until Vladimir Gil, the Prime Minister, came to his office. \n\n"Did I disturb you, my Tsar?"

It is necessary to make sure that no one finds such documents that compromise the murder of the current ruler. Otherwise, it will come back to bite us. \n\nHowever, it's obvious that we'll find something else interesting in these archives, so we'll have to open it up and find everything we can."

 MAR_Kosygin.40.t: "Vigilante justice"
 MAR_Kosygin.40.d: "Several document experts opened a sealed archive of the Ural Oblast Council, which was created during the Civil War. Their task was to go through all the documents in order to find papers that are somehow related to the Tsar's family. To find information about where they were buried (if they were buried), who gave the order for the execution, and so on. It was expected that a lot of these documents could be found, and all similar documents that were discovered could be attributed to the decisions of this Ural Oblast Council. \n\nOpening the door, they smelled the characteristic odor of dust and even some kind of antiquity from the distant past. One of the documents even sneezed when he inhaled the smell. Turning on the light in this forgotten place, they spread out immediately throughout the archive, which was practically filled to the brim with various documentation. A serious question arises - why didn't anyone look here before these document experts arrived? Moreover, this question was even more complicated by the realization of how much time has passed since the door was last opened at all. \n\nPerhaps this has a good side - the archive has not suffered at all. The documents remained intact and undamaged, and time could not make the ink, which was written on the documents, fade. Therefore, there was a lot of information that could be obtained. \n\nSorting through this archive, they found a lot of things, sometimes blatantly useless information. Some of these documents could have been used later to write a course or diploma work on history, but some of them were frankly useless. Nevertheless, all of this was not quite what they needed to find - information about the murder in the Ipatiev House on July 17, 1918. \n\nAnd yet, they suddenly managed to find a very unexpected discovery on this issue. One of the document experts found a whole pile of orders and letters between none other than the Ural Council and Lenin himself. From this correspondence, one very interesting detail is revealed - as it turns out, there was no order to kill Nicholas II and his entire family. Moreover, Lenin only called for a trial of his person and to put him in prison, but the Ural Council did everything on its own, not directly obeying from Moscow. As a result, it turns out that the order for the execution was not given by Lenin from Moscow, but by the Ural Council. \n\nThe archive investigation continues."

A very harsh burial, it should be noted. \n\nArriving at the site, many feared that the acid not only dissolved everything and left nothing behind, but that it would still be present there. No one could say for sure what to expect there. However, our team was very lucky - not only was there no more acid, but they also managed to find the skeletons of the remains of Nicholas II's family. \n\nIn the cave, the bodies of Nicholas II himself, his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, Olga, Tatiana, and Anastasia were found, at least they could be identified, judging by the documents. The most interesting thing in this situation was that other bodies were discovered that clearly did not belong to the royal family - Botkin, Trupp, and Anna Demidova. The bodies of Maria Nikolaevna and Alexei Romanov were not found. The fact that Alexei Romanov's body was not found seemed amusingly interesting to the research team - it seems that the rumor that Alexei II Romanov, who is now in power, actually survived, is true. This is quite amusing, but at the same time, it is very strange. All of this raises many questions."

The years of Soviet propaganda elevated Lenin almost to the level of God, attributing to him qualities that he did not possess, and his role in the establishment of, for example, the Soviet government is also overestimated. On the other hand, he is hated by ardent monarchists, conservatives, and simply anti-communists, who consider Lenin the murderer of Russia in its spiritual and material aspect. Many believe that he was also the murderer of the royal family, even though this idea is mistaken. \n\nNaturally, this figure causes a huge amount of controversy, but it is impossible to deny the fact that he made an indelible contribution to history. However, as befits any person in history, he must become part of that history.

This small unremarkable building was the mausoleum of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, which was almost an exact copy of the mausoleum that was in Moscow before the war. It differed only in that the materials used for this structure were made somewhat coarser and hastily, clearly counting on the fact that the Germans could bomb this structure, and so that it would not turn out that the money was wasted, everything was done quite roughly. But, of course, they did not resort to shoddy work. \n\nTyumen residents watched the process of removing Lenin's mummified body. For many residents, this body, like the mausoleum, became something holy over time, just like for tens of millions of Soviet residents during the Bukharin era. However, the townspeople did not know what to do - Lenin was being removed from the mausoleum with the explicit intention of burying the body. \n\nMany townspeople gathered around the burial site, and in order not to make it too sad for the townspeople and possible sympathizers of Lenin, it was decided to bury him under an orchestra, but without any speeches. The orchestra began to play the Soviet Union's anthem. This anthem is possibly playing for the last time in public, which actually only added even more tears to the Tyumen residents. As soon as someone heard the national anthem of the Bukharin Soviet Union, he began to sing its words. Another person followed suit, and soon the entire crowd began to sing. Three minutes later, the crowd finished singing the anthem, and Lenin's body was carried away in a special vehicle. After the body was placed in the car, it set off and drove away in an unknown direction."

 MAR_kossup_topor_desc: "The October Revolution of 1917 and the Civil War led to a lasting ideological split in Russian society. Reds, who are supporters of Soviet power, and Whites, who are opponents of this power, perhaps always consider each other sworn enemies, although there are no longer any Whites or Reds now. \n\nThe Whites declare their irreconcilability towards the Reds, and the same is done by the Reds. However, it is time to put an end to this almost half-century conflict - they need to be reconciled in the most unusual way - make them part of the same history as Nicholas II and Lenin."

 MAR_Kosygin.43.t: "The Roots of the Conflict"
 MAR_Kosygin.43.d: "The struggle between the Whites and the Reds in the history of Russia occupies one of the most tragic places in the Russian people's memory. Without exaggeration, the Civil War is one of the cruelest conflicts that the world has ever seen, and it cannot be compared with World War I, or even with the Great Patriotic War, but it is still just as brutal. \n\nWhere else could you see a father fighting against his son, or a brother against his brother with a bayonet or a saber? Only the Civil War in Russia separated the fates of many families, and all this because of an idea. The Civil War in Russia is particularly tragic in this respect. However, this struggle has its roots. \n\nRussia is unique in its own way. Only our people have unique qualities that are not inherent in any others - collectivism, unity, and a sense of justice. Our nation contains much in common with socialism, but at the same time, it also needs a tsar, as it is usually extremely loyal to its leader. The Civil War revealed and brought these qualities of the Russian people to their maximum values, which led to the struggle between two principles - monarchical and socialist. Therefore, the struggle between the Whites and the Reds was especially brutal and tragic. \n\nMladorossi were able to combine the monarchical and socialist principles of the Russian people, and now we have no ideological contradictions in our homeland, at least in the part where Mladorossi are in power. We have combined these ideals, but we have not yet solved the last contradiction. And we must solve it, and we will solve it in the most unusual way - we will create a valley of reconciliation for the fallen communists and Whites in the Civil War, and we will bury the bodies of fallen White Guards and Reds there."

The place, which most resembles a tomb, not only carries the meaning of a cemetery, but also represents a gesture of reconciliation between the Whites and Reds. Many Russians like to pride themselves on the fact that their ancestors fought on the side of the Whites or Reds, but at the same time harbored enmity towards those against whom their grandfathers fought. However, now this has come to an end, as this memorial complex has been created with the aim of spiritually uniting all of Russia, which has ambivalent feelings about this issue. \n\nAs a sign of final reconciliation, Lenin's body and the remains of the family of Nicholas II were buried opposite each other. Could anyone ever have thought that these two people, Lenin and Nicholas II Romanov, would ever be buried next to each other? Probably not, but they had to be buried together in a humane way to end the contradictions in the Russian people."

The German people no longer understand what they really want, the American people are at a crossroads, and the Japanese people cannot get rid of the imperialism in their brains. \n\nOur monarchic socialism is progressive, it is directed towards both the future and the past, preserving the traditions of Russia and its spirit, and cementing all of this with socialist ideas of justice, equality, and prosperity. The greatness of the Russian people has been made into a non-man-made state. \n\nAnd we will not stop.

It was much calmer when you knew there was such protection. At some point, you could even think that these 'tin' soldiers had become like family, an integral part of the city. Night shots that scared at first became very rare in the end. \n\nIt could even be said that living according to a schedule became even better, as you knew exactly what you had to do at a certain time, which greatly increased self-discipline and responsibility for any actions, whether at work, in school, or at home. Although there were some changes in the curfew hours, she kept in mind that she had to get everything done before that time. \n\nBut today she walked down the street and did not see these soldiers.

She also noticed that these soldiers were nowhere to be found, and announcements about the lifting of martial law were posted on the street.

There were a lot of people, about 40, and he took his turn. The agonizing wait for his turn began, and as he moved up in line, a seemingly equally small line formed behind him. This surprised Nikolay a bit, although there was nothing surprising about it - no one was trying to dodge the army, at least not those who were vehemently against it.

Наоборот, даже Тухачевский, один из легендарных военачальников Советского союза брал некоторые приёмы, которые вырабатывал Владимир Гиль. Однако те времена прошли, и сейчас он вновь примерил на себя мундир генерала армии. \n\nВойдёт в военный штаб, его уже ожидал Анатолий Вавилов и два-три высокопоставленных генерала, которые были удостоены чести управлять армиями, которые будут действовать в Сибирской войне – последней, решающей войне за единую Россию. Генералы уже начертили некоторые стрелки и планы боевых действий против государства, расположенного в Сибири. \n\n– Здравия желаю, товарищ-генерал Гиль! – Сказали все присутствующие в зале. \n\n– Здравия желаю. Вольно. – Сказал Владимир, явно вспоминая те армейские будни. – Я так смотрю, уже во всю работаете? \n\n– Так точно, генерал. Мы уже начали разрабатывать оборонительные планы и планы наступления на врага. – Начал говорить Вавилов. \n\n— Это хорошо, я хочу на них взглянуть. \n\n— Вот, смотрите. – Начал подводить Гиля к краю стола с картами. \n\nГиль начал рассматривать эти карты очень детально. Он в первую очередь обратил внимание на то, что карты были сделаны очень качественно, чего ранее такого не было. Но его внимание потом тут же переключились на стрелки и расположение дивизий Российской Народной империи и врага. Основной удар намечался, судя по карте, на юге всей Сибири, и здесь есть, конечно, своя логика – основное население и основная промышленность расположена именно на юге Сибири. Однако план всё ещё не был совершенным. \n\n– Угу… – Посмотрел на все карты Гиль. – Они ведь не окончательные? \n\n– Верно подметили, мы начали разработку вот буквально несколько часов назад. \n\n– Это радует. Что-ж, я могу вам подсказать кое-что, что могло бы пригодиться вам на войне. \n\nПосле этой фразы Гиль полностью погрузился в работу по созданию планов войны. Говорят, что чтобы всё хорошо удалось, нужно иметь обязательно запасной план боевых действий, и он был разработан – на случай, если враг вдруг окажется сильнее, наша страна должна будет опереться на оборонительные рубежи, которые можно будет построить в целом незадолго до войны. Строительство авиабаз, для более удобного захвата воздушного превосходства над врагом, строительство бункеров, дорог, мобилизация армии, в общем, – всё, что нужно для войны, было разработано именно в этом штабе. \n\nПлан обороны и план атаки был в конечном итоге доведён до ума. Пока план доводили до ума, Владимир Гиль и Вавилов обсуждали прошлые военные походы. Гиль рассказывал, как он был командиром в Великую Отечественную войну, в Западно-Русской войне, как он был генералом в Битве за Западную Россию, и то, как он успел спасти, по сути, всё Княжество от развала руками Таборицкого и его «престольников». Эти и многие другие общения происходили во время перерывов, которых было не так много, как хотелось бы, так как весь командный состав пыхтел над планом. \n\nВ конечном итоге, план был всё-же подписан, и теперь осталось ждать времени, пока он не будет применён…"

This night is ending, and we are witnessing the Russian nation welcoming this dawn, which has crimson tones. \n\nThe old personality of Alexei II Romanov is in the past. He is not Kosygin, he is not the son of a fitter. He is his own among strangers with the surname Romanov. Of course, Romanov is glad to be the ruler of Russia, but he is still an ordinary son of a turner with the surname Kosygin. He is also a simple person - and he decided to publish his memoirs to tell about himself, without mentioning that he is not a Romanov.

He hid under the guise of Kosygin for just over 30 years, although he kept in mind that he was the true heir to the Russian Empire. Advancing up the career ladder, he achieved success and made the lives of people around him better. But because he was not at the helm of the country, he could not save the country at the right time. That's when he said that socialism as such during Bukharin's time influenced the future Tsar's views strongly, and trying to combine all the best of those times, he eventually created what we call the 'Russian People's Empire.' \n\nThe book ends with the defeat of the evil that sought to destroy Russia from within - the news of Taboritsky's death and the birth of hope for the prosperity of the Russian people are the very end of Alexei II Romanov's 'Scarlet Etude.' \n\nHistory will fully judge and assess Alexei II Romanov's contribution to the well-being of his own homeland."

The group consisted of 7 people. The head of the group was Aslan Burdenov. During the detention, 3 Makarov pistols, 2 Kalashnikov assault rifles, 6 RGDs, and about 500 rounds of different calibers were confiscated. They were sent to the prison of the Mangystau region. \n\nOn Wednesday, a group of individuals attempting to sail to Iran was detained in the Mangyshlak Bay. The group consisted of 4 people. When the coast guard tried to detain them, they opened fire, resulting in a brief shootout that killed all members of the group. \n\nOn Thursday, a group of about 20 people attacked the KGB center in Atyrau. They were radical Islamists intending to blow up the KGB building. During the shootout, 13 members of the gang, 2 KGB members, and 1 civilian were killed, and around 50 people were injured. 1 member of the gang was subdued and is currently in custody. Interrogations have not yet yielded much information, but we believe he will crack soon. The homemade bomb of the gang did not go off. Active searches are underway throughout the Atyrau district."

The arrival was planned for 8:30. But by 8 a.m., the first cars of the elite escort began to enter the city, and the orchestras of military units began to play. After the arrival of the Emperor, a celebration began in the city. People came out in crowds and accompanied Alexei II's car. Finally, his car stopped on the square, and His Majesty climbed onto the newly built tribune. There, Alexei delivered his speech, planned back in Bereznyaky. It spoke of the unity of the Russian and Kazakh peoples, expressed gratitude to local officials for carrying out successful and timely reforms, and offered wishes for the future. \n\nAfter the speech, a grand parade began, which Astana had probably never seen before. The 17th Kazakh battalion, in full force, marched through Memory Square, carrying portraits of Lenin and Nicholas II. After the parade, Alexei visited the main mosque in Astana. There, he was warmly welcomed by the imams, who talked to the Emperor on various topics. After a brief conversation, Alexei, as the ruler of Russia, was blessed for future wars defending the Motherland. Alexei was sincerely moved that the population already considers Russia their homeland and promised funding at the highest level.

Without a doubt. We have not only achieved unity of body and spirit, but we are also creating amazing machines that the world has never seen before. We are unique in everything - our nation, our political system, our technologies, our economy. Perhaps the whole world will realize that we were right and follow us.

And it was not just that, but the hiding cell with the weapons it possessed had been terrorizing the local population for some time, which the regional government could not tolerate.\n\nBefore the operation began, the squad leader Nikolai Skvortsov held a short briefing with the soldiers to remind them of the upcoming task: "Briefly for the dying, so that no one gets hit in the head because of someone's desire to doze off at the wrong time. The enemy, numbering about a platoon, has fortified its positions in wooded terrain where they bring all the loot. The location of their camp is known, so we should move wider until those bastards realize our maneuver. Without reaching a kilometer, our detachment splits up, and the sergeants take their units, encircling the bastards with a ring. At the appointed time, or when you hear the sound of gunfire, we cross-fire them. Grenades are not recommended to be used, as we need prisoners. On fear, throw them without pulling out the pin. The main thing is to cover them quickly so that we can interrogate them before they all lose consciousness from blood loss. After all, no one skipped first aid courses for the sake of smoking? The main thing to remember is that who knows whether they were able to get mines, or if you will not step on an empty can, so there is a high probability that we will need to storm the camp without completing the encirclement of the area, and then the task of the flanks is to cut off the enemy's path of retreat and hold on until we catch up with those running away. Is everything clear to everyone?" To which all the soldiers answered affirmatively.\n\nWhen the squad advanced into the forest for eighteen kilometers, they saw rare figures of people between tents, boxes, and trenches dug into the ground.\n\nThe commander looked through binoculars and ordered all soldiers on the radio: "Readiness - ten minutes." \n\nAfter the specified time, the radio session repeated, but this time the order was to open fire, which caused the rare appearing figures to start falling. The rebels were so stunned that they could not organize any resistance, and some of them were captured unarmed in their tents. Only those who were in the bunker at the time managed to prepare for the KGB operatives approaching them, to which they still threw a grenade into the enclosed space, but only after the explosion, and throwing an unprimed one intended to frighten, did they go inside themselves. When the camp was cleared and the sounds of battle stopped, a voice was heard from the soldiers clearing the rebels' last hiding place, and they were carrying a bearded man with a severed leg after the explosion, which was now awkwardly bandaged, on whose shoulders were epaulets of the Russian Empire and chevrons of the White Guard era.\n\n"My tongue is wounded, medic!"

People gathered not so much to say goodbye to the titans of the Western Russian political scene, but to try to find out the future vector of the government. Everyone tried to find out who was leading the funeral procession.\n\nThe country held its breath when the cortege arrived at the burial site, and it seemed that even nature itself was silent. The first thing that was clear was that the coffins were not empty, as the hands of Belozersky and Kazem-Bek protruded from under the shroud.

Leaving the interrogated in a puddle of his biological fluids, Kanevsky and his men set out to capture the main criminal of all Western Russia.\n\nThe plan was as follows: Kanevsky with his squad would go through the main entrance, while the brigades of the People's Militia, allocated by Gilyu, would occupy every tree and every stone around the shelter. Nobody was supposed to get away. Kanevsky was retouched at the local theater to make it seem like he was beaten, and his team dressed in the uniform of the Stormtroopers of the Old Believers. When Taboritsky himself arrived, the local Old Believers were supposed to butter up the boss with such a gift.\n\nEverything worked out as planned: Kanevsky's team was let in, and they started partying in the center of the shelter, cutting off the Old Believers from their armory and cutting off the alarm. The People's Militia caught or eliminated Stormtroopers who were running out one by one.\n\nResult of the operation: Irreparable losses among the personnel - 2; criminals killed - 14; criminals arrested - 21; the "Head" object was not captured as it disappeared 15 minutes before the start of the operation."

Under such conditions, the soil did not yield as much as in his homeland, which meant that Nikolai Grishchenko could not do his favorite work - agricultural labor - properly.\n\nBut after the situation in the region stabilized and Nikolai accumulated enough money to buy a plot of land and a small property in the center of Samara, he decided to play his trump card. During the evacuation from his native village near Zhytomyr, he was able to take with him 6 bags of Ukrainian black soil. Nikolai believed that bread grown in black soil and baked by his wife Svetlana would simply explode the Samara markets, and perhaps the entire region.\n\nEither way, Nikolai thought that by these actions he was preserving his culture and bringing closer the day when he could again sow and harvest wheat in his native hamlet."

The People's Kingdom, apparently, is based on Orthodoxy...\n\nAt that moment, there was a banging on the door of the church. Opening the door, Vasily saw a scruffy man in a KGB uniform with several soldiers. Vasily's heart sank into his boots like it did back in 1918.\n\n- Father Vasily, good morning. My name is Gleb Moenko, and I represent the State Security Committee. During searches at the Dzhaba Ioselian's camp, we found these icons and worship items. Your village was the nearest settlement, so we thought you were the original owner. Can you confirm this?\n\n- Yes...Yes. These bandits raided the church God knows how long ago. And how did you find them?\n\n- As it turned out, Ioselian knew the Yugra region better than any Ural voivodes. But we had better equipment. Goodbye, Father Vasily.\n\nAfter recovering from the shock, Vasily's heart rose again in his chest and filled with hope and faith. His church would no longer be robbed or desecrated."
 MAR_Kosygin.86.a: "They are red, but not godless."

 MAR_Kosygin.87.t: "From Red to Red"
 MAR_Kosygin.87.d: "From Red to Red.\n\n- Hello, I would like to join the party.\n\n- Good day. Please tell me your name and occupation.\n\n- Borzov Nikita Egorovich. I work at the meat processing plant in the south of Tyumen.\n\n- Thank you very much. Please indicate your address in the questionnaire so that we can send you a letter when your application is accepted..\n\nWhile Nikita was leaning over the sheet of paper, he had only one question in his head:\n\n"Am I doing the right thing? These syncretist-fascists perverted the whole essence of communism by putting a tsar at the head. And what if I run further east? Perhaps that same Soviet Presidium with Yagoda could still be there. Or has it already disappeared in the Troubles? Hell knows, but I have to try. But do I have to… No. I'm tired of running. First from Kharkov, then from Moscow, and now from Tyumen? No, you won't wait. Maybe these syncretists are right, damn it. After all, if the best that Bolshevism can offer is Kaganovich and Khrushchev, then I am not a Bolshevik."
 MAR_Kosygin.87.a: "Reconciliation Street; house 9; apartment 11"

 MAR_Kosygin.88.t: "Underground Gazavat"
 MAR_Kosygin.88.d: "Danislan did not intend to reconcile himself with the fact that Russian infidels had come again to the Kazakh dar al-Islam to kill Mujahideen and impose their religion on the weak. Tonight he and several other young men from his village were to meet at the muadhin's house.\n\n- Son, when you leave, take the rifle off the wall.\n\n- The one that belonged to father? Really...\n\n- He fought against the Communists with this rifle, and then against the Russians. That was his will.\n\nWith the family heirloom on his shoulder, Danislan walked and thought about the plan for the first attack. Maybe on the party building? Or would it be better to attack the police station? They might be able to get some weapons there. \n\nIn his thoughts, Danislan didn't even notice how he had reached the muadhin's house. Danislan felt animal fear. Red star cars were parked in the courtyard, and there were even a few APCs. The house was packed with KGB agents. Musa, Khadir, and other friends and acquaintances lay in a pile with slit throats and bullet holes in their necks. The muadhin was not visible, but his screams could be heard from the shed near the house. Danislan tried to reach for his father's automatic rifle, but heard a burst of dry cracks, after which he stopped feeling his right hand."
 MAR_Kosygin.88.a: "Blood was oozing from it."

 MAR_Kosygin.89.t: "From the fire into the flame"
 MAR_Kosygin.89.d: "Two hours. The road repair has been going on for two hours already. Vasily has become accustomed to the hardships and sufferings of the second turmoil, but nobody could get used to the Kazakh heat.\n\n- Vadik, go fetch the mixer to Mikhalych, they've undermined a part of the road again.\n\n- Fuck, really? They blew it up in the same fucking spot the day before yesterday. Are our guys all okay?\n\n- Looks like a piece of shrapnel hit Petka Trepyov, but the army took him to the hospital. And they got the bastard who did it.\n\n- Alright, tell them I'll finish this section and then I'll come over.\n\nWhile his interlocutor walked away towards the improvised toilet, Vadim had mixed thoughts: "On the one hand, they pay here, compared to Arkhangelsk, like royal bucks, so I can definitely send my daughter to university."
 MAR_Kosygin.89.a: "But damn, it's so fucking hot here."

 MAR_Kosygin.90.t: "An example to follow"
 MAR_Kosygin.90.d: "Unlike other visiting Russian language teachers, Pavel Chirkin had lived in Akmolinsk all his conscious life. His family was part of the Soviet intelligentsia who were relocated here by the party to eradicate illiteracy among the fraternal peoples of Kazakhstan. But after the German invasion, this became secondary, and survival became the main priority. However, after recent events, Pavel could teach both Russian and Kazakh, and the school, his district, and the entire city had been rebuilt and improved after recent battles. Pavel felt that despite all the past tragedies, meaning was returning to his life, which was to serve the good of the Motherland and its people. Not with a gun, but with textbooks of Russian language and literature.\n\nOn one of the first Russian language lessons, one of his longtime students raised his hand.\n\n- Pavel Yevgenyevich, why are we studying Russian now, but we didn't before?"
 MAR_Kosygin.90.a: "- Moldabek, we are studying Russian because Kazakhstan and Russia have become brothers again."

 MAR_Kosygin.91.t: "Fundamental reconstruction"
 MAR_Kosygin.91.d: "The old building in the center of Koksay, built during the late Russian Empire, had not undergone any major reconstruction during the Soviet period, and later it was completely forgotten. However, on the occasion of the visit of Emperor Alexei II to the city, it was decided to begin a major reconstruction three days before his official visit. The chairman of the party committee and his deputy were whitewashing the walls in the main corridor while the rest of the party members were engaged in other activities to renovate the house.\n\n- Sergey Sergeyevich, couldn't we hire local workers?\n\n- We couldn't, Yevgeny Yevgenyevich. At the previous meeting, we decided that we would do the reconstruction ourselves. Besides, work turns a monkey into a man! So we too will achieve something decent.\n\n- Well, do you think we'll manage in time? His Majesty is coming the day after tomorrow, and we still need to polish the roof and install new gates.\n\n- As for the exterior, we hired people. As I heard, even the Archangelsk proletariat is not thrilled by the local heat, and we are even more likely to faint.\n\n- Oh no! Sergey Sergeyevich, please open the window, or else we'll be poisoned by this paint.\n\nAt that moment, a young party member burst through the main door and reported anxiously.\n\n- Sergey Sergeyevich, Yevgeny Yevgenyevich! They just called from the government. They said that His Majesty the Emperor will arrive not the day after tomorrow evening, but tomorrow morning!"
 MAR_Kosygin.91.a: "It seems that the repair will continue until late at night."

Either way, this community now poses a threat to the national security of new Russia, with which the KGB will have to deal. Preliminary investigation results indicate that the group is led by Father Ioann, a former collaborator who was considered missing for a long time. The goals of this organization are a mystery, they operate in the shadows and spare neither their own nor others. We have heard rumors of numerous and extremely brutal executions, up to public beheadings \"in the name of the Lord\". Their connection to the \"Throne\" is indisputable, which is one of the many reasons why we must deal with these terrorists at any cost.§!"
 MAR_ARKHANGELSK_DOSSIER:0 "§YThe activities of the Finnish intelligence agency and the \"White Bandits\" from Onega in the vicinity of Arkhangelsk were well known to the ZRRF, but there was no decisive possibility to eliminate these groups. Now, taking advantage of the chaos that has engulfed Western Russia, anti-communists have emerged from the shadows and act much more confidently, preparing the ground for the future \"Liberation of Northern Russia\". \n\nThe intervention of third parties in the \"Throne\" crisis is a major problem, especially since the Onega residents cover the activities of terrorists in Arkhangelsk, complicating the task of catching them. In addition to this situational alliance, agents and agitators are not connected with the leadership of the \"Throne\" and pursue the interests of their foreign masters.§!"
 MAR_SYKTYVKAR_DOSSIER:0 "§YOVRI, one of the numerous small parties in the Republic of Komi, turned out to be the ideological core of the formation of the \"Throne\", while the government in the capital was busy preparing for the Vyatka Congress. Surprisingly, the party led by the notorious Andrei Dikii operates completely openly and without any fear.\n\nThe KGB can only guess at their true motives, but openly they engage in agitation against the \"self-proclaimed Tsar\" and the Mladorossi party, as well as clashes with the city police and other groups in the region. Although the Taborite accomplices clearly act solely to distract attention from the real leader of the movement, we must still nip the Society's activities in the bud, if only for the sake of the peace and security of the country's citizens.§!"
 MAR_GORKY_DOSSIER:0 "§YThe rise of Alexei Kosygin provoked a sharp reaction not only from the right but also from the left. Among the veterans of the Gorky Tank Army and the Western Russian Revolutionary Front, anti-government sentiments spread widely, leading to the spontaneous formation of the \"People's Red Army\" of General Lashchenko. \n\nContrary to its name, this \"army\" is a veteran organization that opposes the \"distorted tsarist infection\" of Kosygin's socialism. Of much greater interest in the context of the fight against the \"Throne\" is the closely affiliated trade union organization of the Gorky plant. The KGB has reason to believe that these people may be linked to the \"Throne\" and numerous terrorist acts throughout the country.§!"
 MAR_PERM_DOSSIER:0 "§YTo our great regret, the bandits from the 'Aryan Brotherhood' have infiltrated Perm more deeply than we initially thought. With mass uprisings of ultrarights and terrorist acts across the country, these sectarians have also seized the opportunity. According to intelligence, the 'Aryans' are led by Nikolai Ivanovich Kukushkin, one of the most dangerous Aryan executioners known as Baldur Golts. Currently, their connection to the leadership of the Throne remains disputed, although some witness statements at the Vyatka Congress suggest the possible presence of Aryans during the attack.\n\nIn Perm, however, their activity is evident and bloody. Mass executions, building explosions, village burnings, and mistreatment of women are comparable only to the crimes of Nazi executioners during Operation Barbarossa.

 #PRESTOL EVENTS 
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.1.t: "Preparation..."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.1.d: "REPORT\n\nTO: GIL V.V\n\nFROM: MERENOVA I.YA, CHIEF OF THE UKGB DEPARTMENT FOR NARYAN-MARSKAYA PROVINCE\n\nThe first information about the activities of the organization "Tsarebozhniks", which are part of the terrorist network "The Throne", was received by our KGB department in the far north at the beginning of 196X. In connection with this, it was decided to send an agent (-------) to conduct an investigation and establish connections with members of the organization.\n\nThe agent (-------) managed to infiltrate the ranks of the organization during the first month of the mission. The connection was established through acquaintance with a local resident (-------), who sympathized with the terrorists. He brought (-------) to a meeting with representatives of the organization, who were already in its inner circles.\n\nIn order to maintain his cover, the agent (-------) was forced to perform various tasks that attracted the attention of the members of the organization to himself and express support for their ideas. This allowed him to obtain more information about the group's activities, its structure, the location of its gatherings, and operations.\n\nAfter some time, enough information was collected to determine the whereabouts of the main members of the organization. It was established that they were hiding in one of the abandoned buildings on the outskirts of (------]. The agent (-------), using his skills, was able to track down the building and then pass the information to our forces.\n\nThe plan to storm their lair is fully prepared for execution. We await instructions from the central KGB headquarters.\n\nDate: (-------)"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.1.a: "Proceed with the plan. V.V. Gil."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.2.t: "...And the Assault."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.2.d: "Early dark morning, typical for these lands. Special service forces gathered on the outskirts of the city: KGB agents, police officers, and OMON soldiers. They were all on high alert, with one task at hand - to assault the main headquarters of the radical Orthodox terrorists.\n\nEarlier, KGB agents conducted thorough reconnaissance and found out the location of the terrorists' headquarters. Based on the gathered information, an operation plan was developed. It had to be lightning-fast and silent to prevent the terrorists from preparing a counterattack.\n\nBut once on the ground, the agents realized that the plan might not work - the terrorists were waiting for them. The Orthodox fanatics were armed to the teeth: assault rifles, pistols, grenades. They knew that all the special forces were targeting them and were preparing for a fight.\n\nThe KGB agents decided to take a desperate step. Their unit, led by the commander, slowly approached the terrorists' headquarters, covered by a T-62 tank. OMON special forces supported the combat group from the other side, creating a double pressure on the terrorists.\n\nThe terrorists began to shoot, and it was difficult to return fire - they were well protected. But suddenly, the firing stopped. The commander of the combat group, realizing that this was a chance, decided to advance. The first line defending the headquarters was broken.\n\nThe terrorists understood that their chance of victory was slipping away, and they began to retreat, hoping to escape and continue their subversive activities. Most of them surrendered, but some dropped their weapons and disappeared into the forest. Another OMON squad was sent to pursue them.\n\nAs a result of the operation, several Prestolniks were captured, but of course, the majority were eliminated for resistance. We hope that the hydra of the "Prestol" will not be able to raise its head here anymore."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.2.a: "The hydra lost one head."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.3.t: "The White Devil's hideout"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.3.d: "Today in Vyatka, the KGB building was not idle. After receiving data from infiltrated agents in Onega, activity immediately began. \n\n"The information from our agents is not particularly encouraging. However, now we know who we're fighting," the agent said as he pulled out several photos and pinned them to the board. \n\n"Anti-communist brigades in the Archangelsk region are receiving equipment directly from Onega, possibly with Finland being directly involved. The bandits have raided several villages. Interestingly, according to agent reports, a local split occurred within 'The Throne' (Престол) on the North, with one of the rebel villages joining the so-called People's Red Army, as a result of which the Anti-Communist Brigades carried out reprisals against the schismatics. Unfortunately, we cannot take advantage of this. But the fact remains, to destroy this 'Throne' cell, we need to invade Onega."\n\nSilence immediately fell in the briefing room. War with Finland under such instability? Madness! However, apparently, there is no other way."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.3.a: "We must advance."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.4.t: "The Face You Recognize?"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.4.d: "Kirpichnikov was sitting in the truck. Being the leader, he had much more responsibility than the people who had decided to follow him. What did he ultimately hope to achieve? Perhaps he himself did not know. Maybe at some point, he really believed that liberating Northern Russia from the Communists would make Russians' lives better. However, what difference did it make when he was being taken to be shot?\n\nSuddenly, a car coming from the opposite direction stopped and soldiers began shouting. Was the road blocked? Did someone decide to attack the convoy out of desperation? What did it matter, anyway... Amidst the soldiers' shouting, he heard a familiar voice responding to something in the background... something good, yet infinitely sad. "Please understand, I need to talk to him," the unknown man wanted to see someone, surely.\n\nA soldier of the Principality jumped into the truck and gestured for Kirpichnikov to leave. The cold air of the White Sea and the wind immediately reminded Kirpichnikov that he was still alive. A few people armed with weapons stood in front of the column, but they did not show any aggression toward the convoy. Then, one of them, wearing a white uniform and a peaked cap, rushed forward, ignoring the soldiers and the tense atmosphere.\n\nCold hands touched Kirpichnikov's face.\n\n"Volodya, it's me! Do you recognize me?" the old man who rushed toward Kirpichnikov seemed to have forgotten about his advanced age and was overjoyed to meet his friend, like a child.\n\n"Sasha... you're alive," Vladimir recognized him. Alexander Medvedev, with whom they had fought together against the fascists. Time had not been kind to both of them.\n\n"How did this happen?" Medvedev's gaze immediately lost its vitality; apparently, he understood under what conditions this reunion took place. A single tear rolled down his cheek.\n\nThe traitor could not answer, too much water had flowed under the bridge since then. He just gave a glance and tried to turn away.\n\n"Forgive me for what happened. And goodbye." The man in the white uniform reached for something around his waist. And by the time Kirpichnikov realized what was happening, it was too late. A flash..."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.4.a: "The snow turned crimson."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.5.t: "Unexpected revelations"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.5.d: "Once upon a time, when the Komi Republic still existed, Kosygin dealt with ultra-right fascists, the so-called "Passionaries". Without going into details of their movement, Kosygin immediately understood that their ideas were extremely fascist, and what surprised him the most was that Gumilyov's passionary theory was even perceived in the scientific community, although many of the positions in his work can (and should!) be challenged. There was also a certain Igor Shafarevich, who was a good mathematician in the recent past but turned to politics. In theory, he is also associated with the "Throne". \n\nBut still, he had to talk to them. Now the agenda is to fight the "Throne". Even though they are in prison, they are still extremely dangerous for us, as they can contact the "throne supporters". We must first try to interrogate them. \n\nThe first person who entered Shafarevich's interrogation room started his interrogation. \n\n- Surname, name, and patronymic. - The first interrogator asked.\n- Shafarevich Igor Rostislavovich.\n- So, I want to talk to you. I won't ask too complicated questions, so...\n- I will tell you everything you need. - Shafarevich suddenly interrupted.\n- ...Sorry? - The interrogator said in surprise.\n- I won't resist you. It's meaningless to me.\n- What a surprise. Why?\n- I have no reason to hinder you from fighting the "Throne". I know perfectly well what kind of situation you have with Taboritsky's people. I have my own personal scores with this madman, and it will be better for me if you defeat him.\n- It's very unexpected from your side. Well then, please tell me everything you know about him.\nShafarevich, sitting with his arms crossed in a closed position, began to speak:\n- I'll start with the fact that this person is a real lunatic, a monarchist who believes that Alexei Nikolayevich is still alive. The same one that was shot by the Bolsheviks in 1918. I'm surprised that anyone followed him, because any sane person wouldn't. Maybe it was all a joke?\n- So, you think this person seriously believes that Alexei is alive? Then why is he against our current Tsar?\n- Because he believes that your Romanov is not real. - Shafarevich said affirmatively. - He, if my memory doesn't betray me, is Kosygin. I often saw him in the political arena of the Komi Republic. And although Kosygin, pretending to be Romanov, seems to me the biggest deceiver of the century, he is still better than this crazy Taboritsky.\n- What else can you say?\n- I am sure that some of my colleagues are members of this organization. I can't say for sure how many and who exactly, but I am sure they are there. It's mathematically logical, after all.\n- What do you know about Taboritsky's whereabouts?\n- Unfortunately, I can't say anything. - Shafarevich said.\nThe first interrogation of Igor Shafarevich ended. There are still several interrogations ahead. However, such revelations have never been so easily provided to us before."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.5.a: "What will Gumilyov say?"

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.6.t: "No one steps into the same river twice"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.6.d: "From the interrogation of Gumilyov, which was just as revealing as Shafarevich's, some details emerged. It turned out that members of the "Passionaries" party had joined the "Throne" organization, and their main base in Komi was located in a very inconspicuous house on the eastern outskirts of Syktyvkar. This two-story house was famous for being the meeting place of the "Passionaries" and other radically right-wing movements. Gumilyov learned from his comrades that the headquarters of the "Throners" in Komi was located in the same place. \n\nUpon learning of this fact, a local squad of operatives was immediately dispatched. The building was stormed in such a way that the "passionary-throners" didn't even have time to put up a fight. By decapitating the entire local "Throne" movement in this place, we automatically deliver a crushing blow to the entire network, and once this happens, members of this organization will no longer be able to act in a coordinated manner.\n\nThe raid was scheduled for one in the morning. The operatives began the operation, and everything went according to plan. All these people were captured without a single shot fired, and the entire "Throne" cell was destroyed. The whole operation took about 2 minutes. All of them are sent to prison for further action against them."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.6.a: "Finally, this shop has been closed."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.7.t: "Crime..."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.7.d: "Ivan Prokhorov had to survive by any means due to difficult working conditions and low wages. He was approached by some people who offered him good money for providing at least a small amount of explosive material. Although it was a crime, the offer seemed very good to Ivan. He had already done this several times, even though he was checked for the presence of such charges. Apparently, they were not paying attention. \n\nIvan Prokhorov stole explosive material again, almost without realizing that he was committing another crime. Calmly leaving after another working day, he headed to the place where he usually provided these charges. Nothing foretold trouble for him, when suddenly two people approached him from behind and grabbed him by the arms and dragged him around the corner. \n\n"Hey, what are you doing?! Who are you?! Let me go!" Prokhorov said, trying to resist and break free from the clutches of unknown people. \n\nLater, when they had already driven him around the corner, a man in a military uniform appeared before him and addressed him: \n\n"Ivan Prokhorov Petrovich. I am an officer of the Ministry of Internal Security," he said, showing his identity documents. "Don't panic, young man, and listen to me carefully. You have committed multiple thefts at industrial sites, but we can solve all your problems if you help us." \n\nIvan Prokhorov was scared, but after a few seconds he calmed down a bit and said: \n\n"What do you want?" \n\n"We need you to help us find the people you sell your explosives to. They are terrorists from the organization 'Prestol.' Don't worry, you are not on the suspect list, but you can help us deal with them," the officer explained. \n\n"Yes, I agree... I agree to help you," Ivan Prokhorov said, a little confused. \n\n"Good. I'm glad you understand us. Tell me, where are they?"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.7.a: "Crime arises from unfavorable living conditions."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.8.t: "...and Punishment"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.8.d: "Ivan Prokhorov provided information about where he sold his explosives. The operational team took their positions to catch those who were supposed to receive the explosives. Twenty minutes after the operatives arrived, the "Prestolniki" arrived at the meeting point. As it turned out, the "Prestolniki" were supposed to meet a very large shipment of explosives that was supposed to go to Taboritsky's main group. Apparently from the conversations, they were supposed to be here for the last time, and they expected several such explosive suppliers from different factories in Gorky. However, this should not happen.\n\nSuddenly, the operatives began their operation. The escape routes were immediately cut off, and anyone who resisted was shot in the torso. The leader of this "Prestol" cell was captured and sent to prison.\n\nAll those who were associated with this organization were extremely poor workers. Therefore, the operatives sent a request to the center to increase wages at the factories in Gorky. This will help prevent such situations in the future, as happened recently."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.8.a: "Any well-fed person will not go against the authorities."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.9.t: "Chase in the forest"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.9.d: "Hans ran along the road without looking back. A few minutes ago, his true Aryan squad was attacked by the forces of the damned Mongoloids. The idiots were scared of the non-commissioned officers and scattered in different directions, those who tried to resist were shot. What kind of idiots were assigned to his care?\n\nHowever, the forest did not seem to end, and the atmosphere was slowly crushing the mind of the Aryan. The trees seemed like monsters, stretching their bony hands. The terrifying figure constantly peered out from behind these monsters, as if the forest king himself wanted to enjoy such a hunt.\n\nCenturies-old crowns covered the sky, and something grabbed the officer by the legs. The creature made of wood grabbed him and did not let him go. Just a little more and it would have extended its thin claws to his head, after which the whole world plunged into darkness...\n\nThe private of the people's principality army, who ran up, decided to catch his breath first. "What a sporty one we've got, damn it. Nothing and not such are bothering us. Hey, why are you silent?" - the Aryan did not respond to the soldier's musings, which was extremely uncharacteristic. "No, no, don't tell me you..." - the soldier had forgotten about fatigue and approached the body. Turning it over, he found that the Aryan was unconscious but still alive. During the escape, he stumbled over a fallen branch and hit his head so hard that he lost consciousness. However, nothing critical. Only the soldier was annoyed, as he now had to carry this body back to the squad on his own."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.9.a: "At least there will be someone to interrogate."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.10.t: "The Last of the Brothers"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.10.d: "Thanks to the first interrogation, we have information about the existence of the rogue squads of the Aryan Brotherhood, who apparently continue their struggle against our forces. Having made contact, apparently, with the "Throne", they intended to reclaim what was lost during the Battle for Western Russia. However, they will not be able to do so, and our special services will strike the final, decisive and deadly blow to this hydra. \n\n- Our troops are on high alert. - Dmitry reported over the radio. \n\n- Understood. The other units are also ready. Begin Operation "Swastika". Crush these Nazis! - responded the main headquarters of the military operations. \n\n- Affirmative, executing. \n\nAt 8 o'clock in the morning, a shot from the signal rocket launcher alerted the other units to the start of the operation. The Brotherhood partisans were caught off guard, but attempted to organize a circular defense. Using the weapons they stole from the warehouses, they tried to resist, but the operatives easily broke through the first lines of defense of the Brothers. It is noteworthy that there were no prisoners, as the order was given not to take the ordinary rank-and-file soldiers captive, but only the partisan commander. \n\nAs a result, the entire battle lasted about an hour, and the Aryan Brotherhood partisans were destroyed. The whole battle was a slaughterhouse. The last of the "brothers" was a certain Adolf Mayer. This man was taken in for questioning, and he is still being held there." 
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.10.a: "Finally, they were defeated."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.11.t: "Escort mission"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.11.d: "- Do we really have to catch such a small fry? Why not hunt officers instead... \n\n- The driver knows exactly where to go. And this truck is far enough behind the convoy. \n\n- Do they really not care about what they're doing? And if they hadn't intervened, we would have followed them to Moscow? \n\n- Even to Germany. As for the first one - when Vlasov was gone, the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia passed to Octan, and he doesn't care about anything that doesn't bring him money. \n\nIn the middle of the road through the forest, a lone truck with the insignia of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia got stuck right on the road. The wheels sunk in the mud couldn't make the truck escape captivity. Several soldiers and the driver had been struggling with the force of nature for four hours, but apparently, without help, they wouldn't be able to do anything. Suddenly, the attempts to pull out the truck were interrupted by a call from behind: "Stuck? Can we help?". These words were uttered by none other than the leader of the West Russian People's Principality. In an instant, the members of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia found themselves surrounded by about half a dozen armed men. Soldiers dropped their weapons out of surprise, and the driver tried to climb back into the cab. However, this attempt was interrupted personally. \n\n- Where are you going? - said the leader, grabbing the almost climbed driver by the belt and pulling him towards him. In a few seconds, the driver was lying in the soggy mud and looking at the barrel of a pistol pointed straight at his face. - So where were you heading?\n\n- Don't shoot! To Moscow for cargo. \n\n- And then where would you go? \n\n- I don't know. The gathering point was moved, and we would only find out about its location after crossing the Samara border. \n\n- Oh, well, get ready. We'll take you and your people now."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.12.d: "Report of the Ministry of Internal Security - №007451 \n\nON THE INTERNAL SECURITY OPERATION.\n\nCONFIDENTIAL.\n\nOur operatives conducted the "BORDER" operation in the Samara region at 12:00 to prevent the activities of "PRESTOL" on the territory of this region. \n\nOperation status: COMPLETE SUCCESS.\n\nExplanation:\n\nOur operatives detected suspicious activity in this region. Trucks with markings of the COMMITTEE FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA crossed the border of the WESTERN RUSSIAN PRINCIPALITY from the side of the MOSCOW REICHSKOMMISSARIAT. Immediately after detection, the "Alpha" unit launched an attack on the convoy. Capturing the convoy gave us: \n\n12 trucks of the GAZ-AAA type \n\n100 automatic rifles\n\n50 grenades\n\n5 anti-tank grenade launchers\n\n10 pistols\n\nAmmo for them.\n\nThe map of convoy movements. \n\nThe "Alpha" unit, using this map, coordinated the actions of other units, which struck in the area of the small town of TERENKA, where the KONR unit was based. As a result of a short battle, the KONR unit was destroyed by our forces, and the leader of this unit was captured. Interrogation is expected. \n\nRecommendation: It is necessary to check our border troops for connections with "PRESTOL"."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.13.t: "Operation "Falldown""
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.13.d: "From the interrogations of all the prisoners we captured during previous operations, we found out the actual location of Taboritsky and the center of her entire network. It is located on the border with Western Siberia - in the Ural Mountains region in the Gayny region. The fact that she has a base there is an extremely curious fact, at least as it seems to Vladimir Gil, who decided to personally lead this operation. \n\nThe most experienced operational forces were thrown into battle. Those who have not yet died from enemy bullets, terrorist attacks, and other things, and those who simply performed their work decently - they will, we would like to believe, perform the last task that will bury "Prestol" once and for all. Even equipment was thrown into battle: BTR-60 will provide fire support to the operatives. \n\nThe operation was supposed to begin at 23:30, when the sun would rise finally, to strike a crushing blow to "Prestol". Searchlights and lanterns will help find the last terrorists in this area. \n\nFinally, at 23:30, Vladimir Gil himself fired a single rocket - red, which alerted the operatives about the start of the operation. After that, several searchlights were immediately launched into the sky, illuminating the area. The operatives began to move forward under the light of the rockets, moving towards the edge of the forest to reach Taboritsky herself. \n\nThe "Prestol" members immediately understood what was going on. The experience of the recent "Swastika" operation, which the operatives carried out, was extracted, and now the "Prestol" members took measures to defend themselves. Evtyukovich, along with Viktor Larionov, organized the defense from their last forces of "Prestol". Since they did not have enough explosives, weapons, and people by this time, the defense was very fragile. The only thing these people had was hatred for the new regime and the determination to resist to the very end, regardless of these factors. \n\nA shootout began, which the "Prestol" members initially endured, but then very soon the defense of "Prestol" began to show huge breaches. \n\n"Sergey, it's better for you to run from here. I will hold them as much as I can," Viktor Larionov said to Sergey Taboritsky. \n\nTaboritsky, who was in some confusion at the time, even realizing that his end was near, agreed with Viktor's proposal. But he ran away without any protection. He ran towards the Ural Mountains, holding only the Bible in his hands. \n\nThe battle continues..."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.14.t: "Advent"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.14.d: "Taboretsky had fled so far in the direction of the Ural Mountains that he seemed to be just a little more and he would cross the border of Western Russia and be able to reach Western Siberia. Gasping for air, he climbed up the mountain where more and more snow appeared as he progressed. Taboretsky just ran wherever his eyes led him, because even in his cluttered head he understood that it seemed like the end. The Holy, true Russian Orthodox Russia was just lost, it finally fell before the Judeo-Bolshevik mimicry. It's all over. \n\nTaboretsky was completely exhausted when he saw a very small lake that reflected the moonlight. It was crystal clear, and you could even drink this cold water without any danger. Taboretsky suddenly felt very thirsty, and he wanted to approach this spring. As he moved towards the spring, he slowed down to get a better look at this source, and with each passing second, he was horrified more and more – the crystal-clear spring turned into a bloody one. \n\n"What does it all mean? Hallucinations? Is this true? What is all this?!" Taboretsky said to himself, clearly not understanding what was happening. \n\nA sudden teenage voice frightened him: "You failed the task." \n\nTaboretsky looked around and saw the figure of a boy to his left, and Sergey unmistakably identified Alexei Romanov in him. He couldn't believe his eyes, his eyes trembled with a hellish range of emotions: fear of what would happen next, joy that he was still right, surprise that he found Alexei, and shock he experienced when he saw all this. Which of these emotions prevailed? Fear. This emotion began to dominate all others. \n\n"Forgive me, Alexei... I couldn't do it. I wanted to, I tried..." Taboretsky began to speak, bowing his knees before Alexei Nikolaevich. \n\n"It's okay. I saw everything. You failed, but I forgive you." \n\n"Really?"\n\n"Come with me. We have other matters where you will succeed." \n\nTaboretsky wanted to go with Alexei, but he suddenly felt a strong headache, fell from weakness, and collapsed on the ground..."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.15.d: "After a brief battle in which the entire 'Prestol' was destroyed and the leaders of the terrorists were captured, the advanced search squad began looking for Taboritsky in the district. Everyone was afraid that Taboritsky had managed to escape to Western Siberia and was already plotting his next move, but luck was on their side.\n\nThe advanced squad discovered Taboritsky's body near a small lake. Around his body was a small pack of wolves who, apparently, wanted to eat the corpse, but did not. Why? It is not clear. Nevertheless, the wolves were frightened by the squad and scattered in different directions.\n\nIt was easy to identify the body, but the cause of death was most likely a cerebral hemorrhage. It was decided to bury Taboritsky near that place and make an anonymous grave so that no one could ever identify him.\n\nGilu was informed of the final destruction of 'Prestol', and Gil passed this news on to Alexei Kosygin. Now that 'Prestol' is no more, the country can truly be governed."

If there is any progress anywhere, it is not a decisive blow to the 'Prestol.' Their forces seem infinite, like devils from hell - they cannot be defeated, only expelled for some time, but then they come back. These demons are breaking the state, which was so hard to build by the Mladorossi.\n\nA year has passed since that attempted assassination. Kosygin understood perfectly well that they would try to strike sooner or later. If not in a week or a month, then in half a year or a year. It seems that the deadline is coming to an end, and there will soon be a second, successful assassination attempt. We just need to wait, because nothing can be done - 'Prestol' proved to be too strong for us.\n\nKosygin needed to breathe fresh air to somehow ward off these gloomy thoughts. But as soon as he stuck his head out, a bullet came straight to his head. The sniper, who was on the opposite side of the street, was waiting for his victim. Kosygin fell, making a dull sound.\n\nIt was done. Kosygin was dead. 'Prestol' won this battle. It's all over."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.17.d: "After destroying the power of Kosygin in Western Russia, "Prestol" attempted to seize power in the country. Taboritsky, who declared himself the regent of the Sacred Russian Empire, found that his organization "Prestol" began to fall apart. Many other supporters of this organization, who supported Taboritsky only because they did not recognize the power of Western Russia, began to break away. The remnants of former pseudo-leaders of the country began to break away from the organization, declaring their power in the territories of various regions. \n\nAt the same time, Vladimir Gil, the Prime Minister of the West Russian Popular Principality, announced his seizure of power, but his forces were not enough to subdue all the other regions. Regions began to break away from the Principality, and in the country itself, there was dual power. However, there will be no struggle for a single throne in Western Russia - Taboritsky and Gil cannot establish any influence over this territory themselves, and ultimately everything returned to its former state. \n\nWestern Russia is slowly but surely sinking into chaos. There is no single power, no single border, and once again, as in the era of warlords, borders began to appear within this once united country. If Western Russia can see a single ruler, it won't be anytime soon. Hunger, war, and devastation have once again descended on this part of Russia."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.18.d: "Late morning. A dirt road. A van with two men in the cab drives through the bumps and potholes from the forest to the city. Nothing portends trouble. The radio plays calmly on one of the waves, while the cargo in the back of the van is shaking like hell, adding to the symphony of the radio and the driver's conversations with the passenger. Suddenly, a strange bald-bearded man runs out of the woods onto the road, screaming for help.  \n\nThe car stops on the side of the road while the man runs to the door. He crawls to the driver literally on his knees. They are already asking about his condition, but the old man continues to sob. Not knowing what to do, they decide to take a sedative from the first aid kit. BUT… \n\nShot. Second shot. The entire surrounding forest is set in motion. Birds, awakened by the shots, fly wherever their eyes can see, while the other inhabitants of the forest try to hide. Two lifeless bodies almost simultaneously fall face down to the ground. The man puts away the murder weapon and lights a cigarette.  \n\nAfter regaining his composure a bit, he inspects the cargo in the van. "Nothing useful. And when did they stop making this crap?" - the man says to himself, taking out a notepad and pencil. Opening one of the last pages, he rereads the neatly written text: "Task: destroy important agitators of "Prestol". Do everything quietly. If possible, take important documents and deliver them to headquarters. Task status: ____". In the space for the blank, he writes: "Completed by Serov I.A."

Several hundred paper copies of the same content were dipped in ink and taken out within a few moments every second. The big letters on their front pages read: 'Alexei Kosygin - LIAR!' It seemed that this idyllic atmosphere would continue throughout the day without any major changes. \n\nThe clock's hands slowly approached the number 2 when a deafening ring echoed in the air. It felt like someone had struck a gong inside the building. Within seconds, heavily equipped soldiers burst into the building. Through the ringing, one could hear: 'ON THE GROUND, YOU SONS OF BITCHES! ON THE GROUND!' \n\nWithin a few minutes, everything was over. The director of the printing house was being dragged out of his workplace and pushed into a police van, which was already filled with a huge number of other employees of the printing house. They were taken to the main KGB office in Beryozniki, where they would spend the rest of their lives. Simultaneously with the opposition's departure, the printing machine was also shut down. Hundreds, even thousands of newspapers were carried out and thrown into the back of a van, where they were packed into boxes. The fate of these paper publications was quite obvious: in an hour or maybe more, these boxes with their contents would be burned somewhere on a landfill under Beryozniki.

The drumming of raindrops resounded loudly on the balcony, making it impossible for the man to smoke in peace. Realizing that he wouldn't be able to focus on his work, he went inside and closed the door. "Shitty weather," he muttered, "I'll have to act fast, or everything will be ruined." \n\nAfter listening to his companion, the man tuned in to the radio receiver again and began to frantically adjust the frequency. After several minutes of struggle, he finally managed to connect to the desired channel and briefly transmitted: \n\n- Goose, this is Hata, over. The weather is terrible, we have to act fast. \n\n- Hata, this is Goose, over. Understood, we will act fast. \n\nAnd once again, the headphones were filled with static noise. It seemed to blend perfectly with the sound of raindrops, creating a symphony no worse than those heard in philharmonic halls and theaters. But while one end of the line was pondering music, the other was receiving final instructions: \n\n- ...The plan has changed. We need to act quickly. The reason is the rain. So, there's almost no time. You have literally five minutes for everything. If you miss the moment, it's the end for all of us. Clear?\n\nCrystal clear!\n\nIn that case, take your positions and stick to the plan. Remember, truth is more important than life!\n\nWith these words, four people hid in the luggage compartments of the Ikarus bus, which was taking Party members to a congress in the capital. They had about three hours to spend there, and at the moment when Party members would be leaving the bus for five minutes, they had to install the explosive charges in the designated locations of the Party building and leave Berezniki in the same way. \n\n...The operation, which took five minutes, went flawlessly.

Everyone present, without exception, fell silent and stood up. But after paying tribute to the fallen, he began his fiery speech:\n\n"Comrades! I cannot believe that this really happened. I do not want to believe that people in their right minds can commit such an act. I cannot believe that such an immoral and terrible deed can be committed by a Russian person! Our nation is the greatest nation in the world and it is impossible for me to keep silent about this! I will shout with all my might so that our entire great people can hear the truth! And the truth is that the notorious 'Prestol' organization is behind this terrorist act."\n\nThe hall gasped, but overall it was evident that they were not surprised, but rather confirmed their suspicions.\n\n"Yes-yes, you all understood correctly, my dear friends! Behind all of this is Taboritsky and his pathetic henchmen. These social rejects, who cannot respond normally to criticism and immediately resort to insults, that's all they are! I knew they were radicals, and moreover, we ourselves are a radical wing of Alexei II, but to such an extent... Can you imagine a situation where to achieve a goal one has to kill their fellow citizens? And I can't! But Taboritsky and his criminal gang can! My verdict is this: 'Prestol' and all those who defend it are traitors to Russia and the Russian people! They must be crushed like cockroaches! And that's exactly what I expect from Alexei II! I will smash my head, but I will make my way to his office and persuade him to take appropriate measures! Because in someone - in someone, but in Alexei Nikolaevich I cannot doubt. He can strangle these murderers and scoundrels with an iron grip, I know it! After all, Alexei Nikolaevich is a great man! He went on the radio day and night to support the people, took appropriate measures, immediately ordered sappers, engineers, and other specialists to be sent to the scene of the tragedy. Because he loves Russia, he loves Russians, and that is the main aspect of Patriotism! Hooray for Alexei Nikolaevich, the monarch of Russia!"

A small strip of light was squeezed at the horizon and barely illuminated the tops of the high-rise buildings. But most of the city was lit only by streetlights and lamps. Almost all the windows lit up and dinners, meetings with guests, and other family events began. Despite the horror, the city continued to live.\n\nIn connection with the increase in crime in the city, emergency measures were introduced aimed at combating it. One of these was a curfew, requiring all citizens not to leave their place of residence from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. Such measures are aimed at enhancing the safety of the population. The People's Militia and military units assigned to patrol the streets are monitoring compliance. If violators are detected, they should be brought to the police station. But these measures were not always strictly observed.\n\nAt 10:30 PM one of the days of reinforced protection of the population, a soldier entered the courtyard in a residential area and discovered a group of minors playing on the street. Checking the time, he approached them, but they either didn't notice him or didn't want to notice him. In the end, he went straight to the playground when they only noticed him. \n\n-Young people, do you know what time it is now?\n\n-What's the matter, are we late for something? \n\n-Definitely. It's been half an hour since curfew. \n\n-March home, or you'll have to take a walk to the nearest station. \n\n-Thank you for the information, private. We have taken it into account and weighing all the pros and cons, we have decided to accept your proposal.\n\n-You are thinking right.\n\nFinishing the conversation, the guys turned around and headed for the entrances to their homes, shaking hands with each other. Soon no one was left in the yard except the soldier. Realizing that the job was done, he continued to patrol the city."
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.22.a: "The safety of citizens is paramount."

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.23.t: "Principles of DND work"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.23.d: "Five people were walking along the empty streets of Bereznikov, illuminated by streetlights. Red armbands indicating their affiliation with the Druzhina, which was formed in Bereznikov due to the huge increase in crime associated with the terrorist attack on the Party headquarters, adorned their sleeves. Occasionally, cars would pass by, attracting the attention of the Druzhina members, who would turn around and watch them go. \n\nStreet gave way to street, block by block, but nothing interesting happened. Often the moon peeking through the clouds was the only companion that could join the squad. Surprisingly, their arsenal of weapons was limited only to their own fists. This fact looked even stranger against the backdrop of the fact that some of the criminals did have weapons. But still, the majority were just marauders who looted stores. \n\nMidnight was approaching. Eyes began to droop, yawning overcame the brave fighters defending order in Bereznikov, and their legs became tangled. They wanted to spit on everything and go home or ask people for help, or just fall asleep on the street. Sleep mercilessly overcame them. It seemed that everything would end like this if the head of the squad had not seen the broken window of the department store. "Quiet!" - he hissed to his men. The team immediately fell silent. Approaching the broken window carefully, the commander called everyone over to him. "You stay here, maybe the thief will try to escape," he whispered to one of the guys. The latter only nodded in solidarity. The commander looked around and climbed into the store, followed by three other Druzhina members. Showing each one the direction of the search with gestures, he walked straight ahead. The rest did not stay behind and also began to search the department store. The shelves were half-empty, which was explained by the panic of the people. Searching meter by meter, they approached the end of the store when a piercing scream was heard from the street. In a moment, the entire squad was already outside, watching as the comrade who stayed behind caught the thief. "Well, darling, let's go to the police station," the leader said to the captured criminal, simultaneously congratulating the Druzhina member who caught the thief." 
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.23.a: "Our Druzhina is the best Druzhina in the world!"

 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.24.t: "Remembering and sharpening knives"
 MAR_Kosygin_Prestol.24.d: "A column of people with Kosygin walks to the monument along Bereznicum, symbolizing the strength of Russians. \n\nA huge crowd of people gathered near the administration building in Bereznikov, waiting for Alexey Kosygin to come out. Many of those gathered held portraits of their loved ones, but fortunately, most of those present came empty-handed. The portraits depicted people who died in the terrorist attack at the Party headquarters. \n\nFinally, Alexey Kosygin comes out of the administration building dressed in black. After greeting those gathered, he first asks for a minute of silence, thus remembering the dead. In this way, the procession silently goes to Central Park. As they walked through the city streets, the crowd grew. More and more people joined them, grieving for the deaths of innocent people. Soon the column passed along the main street, which was closed for this purpose in advance, and entered the park. In the very center was a monument with an eternal flame. The monument was made of granite. It depicted a soldier covering a little girl with a rose - a flower of peace. \n\nFinally, at the end of the march, Kosygin climbed onto an improvised platform and, using a microphone, gave a speech:\n\n-Comrades! Today we have gathered here to honor the memory of our loved ones. Today we are here to unite and, overcoming the pain of loss, send our loved ones on the next journey. But we are also here to unite against those who arranged this tragedy; against those who poisoned the lives of ordinary citizens, impregnating their minds with diabolical lies; against those who question the unity of the Russian people; against one person - Sergei Taboritsky. Of course, we cannot underestimate the significance of the "Throne" in these matters, but it is Taboritsky who is guilty of this. He wanted to destroy us - the government, in order to rule the country alone. But he failed. Because I have you - my people, who are ready to help me in any situation, and I am ready to help you in return. And together we can overcome all difficulties, no matter what!"

During a demonstration in support of the Young Russia Party and the government of Alexey II in the region of (------), a group of unknown individuals used a makeshift explosive device. \n\nDuring the panic caused by the explosion, another couple of dozen people died in the stampede. Afterward, the terrorists took hostages in a residential building. The special forces managed to enter the building and eliminate the threat, but some of the hostages could not be saved."

The information that recently fell into the hands of agents was supposed to shed light on the whereabouts of the leader of the terrorist organization "Prestol," Sergei Taboritsky.\n\nNaturally, Vladimir Gil had to personally verify the information. After all, blindly trusting the captives would be overly naive.\n\nThe door to the briefing room opened with a characteristic creak, and a young employee entered with a stack of documents and photographs.\n\n"So, what's the news?" Vladimir spoke calmly, but his appearance betrayed some concern.\n\n"The available information has been confirmed. Taboritsky's hideout is really in Gayny. Based on aerial photography, we were able to determine the approximate location of the cell."\n\n"Hmm. That's it. Let's help people with a pure heart," Vladimir said.\n\nThen followed an analysis of the area and preparation for the elimination operation. The operation was codenamed "The Fall.""

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.1.d: "They meet you by your clothes, but see you off by your mind. This saying could best characterize Glushkov's visit to Guandun. The neon signs and lights of the big city were mesmerizing, but underneath them lay a rotten, corrupt, and exploitative system. However, despite all the imperfections, lessons could be learned from this experience. \n\nIn the end, Victor was not here to establish social justice or liberate all workers in China. Now he was only interested in scientific progress in the field of electronics, and it was precisely in this area that Guandun was truly famous. The state on the cutting edge of progress should become the starting point for creating OGAS. However, local technologies are much more oriented towards a market economy. And planning technologies are only used here to analyze the market. But you have to start the development somewhere.\n\nVictor Glushkov's week-long visit ended with a personal conversation with the current CEO. The topics raised during the conversation, as well as its outcome, will probably never become public knowledge. And now the main ideologist of OGAS leaves a country of contrasts. A place where neon signs hide poverty and the latest technologies serve to enrich the chosen few. Perhaps someday he will return here, but with completely different goals."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.2.t: "First Day at the Academy"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.2.d: "Igor understood little about state affairs, so he had no idea what awaited him in his new position. After all, he had shown excellent results in his native Archangelsk Academy and was among the "royal scholarship holders," so the sudden transfer to an unknown enterprise on the Volga seemed strange to him. Perhaps someone from the top management had it in for him. But what difference did it make?\n\nThe fact remained - he was transferred from a prestigious academy to some institution on the Volga that literally no one had ever heard of! And so Igor stood with other lost students near the entrance, perhaps all of them had done something wrong in their time. Maybe this was the most important lesson he learned at the Northern State University. \n\nSoon, a middle-aged man in a business suit appeared in front of the group and began his speech: "Hello, dear students of the Volga Cybernetics Academy. As you understand, your enrollment here looked chaotic and completely spontaneous. However, I am here to dispel all your doubts and explain why you are here today, please follow me."\n\nThe group of students followed the guide, the building inside looked very solid, but the real treasure was in the rooms.\n\nRows of state-of-the-art computers of Japanese production and rooms with mainframes.\n\nAfter such a demonstration, the students were inspired and ready to start studying. Igor was especially happy, his talent was recognized and appreciated."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.3.t: "Meeting with Big Blue"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.3.d: "The gloomy weather of New York was not kind to the delegation from the People's Empire. The motorcade drove through the busy streets while Pyotr Demichev admired the city streets. A huge amount of advertising, hundreds of people with their destinies and worries constantly rushing somewhere. Perhaps Russia will become like this.\n\nMeanwhile, the motorcade approached the IBM office, which was already prepared for the visit. A whole delegation of efficient managers and Thomas Watson himself was supposed to effectively present the product. Unfortunately, they still did not know that all of this made little sense.\n\nEverything went according to the script, a presentation of the latest IBM System/360 mainframes and many conversations about the capabilities of these machines. Unfortunately, Pyotr Demichev did not understand much about the new-fangled machines. But even he was impressed by the enthusiasm with which they presented these pieces of metal.\n\nIn the end, it all came down to whether the company could meet the needs of the empire. And unsurprisingly, the company was willing to sell a decent batch of Model 91 at a favorable price, and it was possible to order additional ones. In the end, it was decided that a shipment of the first 10 machines, together with the service personnel, would arrive in Russia next month."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.4.d: "Alexey II has always been personally interested in matters related to the development of the 'OGAS' system and therefore always monitored the progress of this project. That's why when it was necessary to build a whole city on the Volga for the sake of continuing the project, the Tsar approved the construction and constantly demanded reports on the work done. And now it was time for the last meeting before the nationwide opening of the city. \n\nAs expected, the construction was almost finished, but an unexpected fact was revealed in the middle of the meeting. The city still didn't have a name! Until now, it had only a code name "KBR-1" in the documents and had no real name. Therefore, an emergency brainstorming session began to come up with a name. \n\n"I suggest the name Mladograd," proposed Nikolai Maslennikov. "This name makes sense and, in the end, reflects the spirit of cybernetics!" \n\nAlexey II's face didn't flinch, but he didn't like the name. \n\n"And I think the city should be named Bergburg after the head of the St. Petersburg Institute and the man who has done a lot for the country's radio electronics," Glushkov replied. \n\nAlexey II was still unimpressed with the option. On the one hand, to name the city in German, and on the other hand, to name it after such an insignificant figure nowadays... \n\n"Cybergrad-on-the-Volga," Kosygin-Romanov quietly said. \n\nThere was a moment of silence in the office. After that, the name was approved, and the meeting ended."
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.4.a: "Cybergrad it is."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.5.t: "Clearing the Area"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.5.d: "Today, Alexey Kanaev, the CEO of the Kazan Electrotechnical Plant, received a very unusual order from the government. It was necessary to free up a space about the size of a storeroom for computers. Naturally, such a space was not available, and the director and the head of the economy department were dealing with this. \n\n"Maybe we should forget about it? Write that we don't have the opportunity to allocate space," Vasily Ibyatov began. \n\n"Ah, the liar came up with something. Do you know what they do with such people?" Alexey said, placing his finger around his neck. "And in the cold, they fine all the top officials at the plant, so it's also in your best interest!" \n\n"Well, then we can take out the storeroom and put the computers there!" \n\n"And where will all the tools be?" \n\n"I don't know, let our paper-pushers squeeze together for a while. They're not doing anything anyway." \n\n"Okay, gather the guys then. We need to start moving now, and the computers should be delivered by lunchtime." 
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.5.a: "In a tight space, but not offended."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.6.t: "Report №001"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.6.d: "Subject: Testing the «OGAS» system in Kazan\n\nDescription: As part of testing the «OGAS» system on several factories located in Kazan, special rooms were installed for information processing at the factory.\n\nResult: Preliminary results show a 25% increase in efficiency and improved product accounting. On the negative side, it was found that the machines consume too much electricity. Also, due to the fact that the allocation of space for computers was done in a hurry, the results of the first few days were unsatisfactory. Further development is required."
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.6.a: "Noted."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.7.t: "Factories of the new generation"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.7.d: "Work at the Kazan Electrotechnical Plant was going on as usual after the installation of computers. No one even noticed their presence. The work continued as usual for everyone except the accounting department. Even Alexey Kanaev, the director of the factory, tried to learn how to operate the computer installed in the manager's office. And during one of his attempts, Vasily Ibyatov entered the office in a cheerful mood.\n\n— Look, Lyokha, the machines really work well. We might even significantly increase production.\n\n— Yes, they work well, but aren't you afraid that they will replace you next?\n\n— How can they replace me? The machine can figure out how to clear a whole room of junk in just a couple of hours and connect the computers to the network by the evening.\n\n— Well, I might be getting carried away. But think about it. In the future, machines will be able to write and draw and probably do most of the work. What will be left for humans then?\n\n— By that time, we will be retired. We will live the good life and relax. — After this remark, Vasily laughed, while his interlocutor, Alexey, just looked thoughtfully at the computer monitor."
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.7.a: "Someday."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.8.t: "Hello, World!"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.8.d: "Today, the graduate students of the Volga Cybernetics Institute were in a special state of excitement. For the first time, computers from several universities were successfully connected to a single network! This event undoubtedly caused excitement and interest. But there was also a downside to all this excitement. Being in a liminal state between the past and the future, the students hesitated to approach the machine. But one student was brave enough to come forward and start testing. Igor Nechaev stepped out of the crowd and approached the keyboard. In complete silence, the keys typed out «Hello World,» and then another press of a key and the message was sent.\n\nSilence filled the room. What if the whole experiment collapses right before their eyes? A second, ten seconds, a minute, two. Time passed excruciatingly slowly. But then the machine's screen lit up and displayed new text. Not the text that was previously typed! Igor leaned forward, adjusted his glasses, and loudly read out, «Why not state-owned?» A short silence was broken by loud laughter, which then smoothly transitioned into applause."
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.8.a: "It's working."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.9.t: "The Fate of Man"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.9.d: "The day started off poorly for Ivan Federov. He knew that sooner or later he would be replaced by a machine. It was bound to happen, but each time it seemed like a problem of the future. But that tomorrow finally came.\n\nWhere to go now? He could only do accounting as part of a whole department. And now, only a few people behind computers can handle it. Out of anger, the worker snapped. He promised himself to quit smoking this week, but that plan went out the window. He caught his eye on an ad in the newspaper he picked up this morning, hoping to read it at work. "State courses for training system administrators..." It sounded very tempting. "Guaranteed employment after graduation and basic facilities provided."\n\nIvan found a notebook and pen in his pocket and wrote down the address from the ad. Then he rushed to the address. The building was supposed to open soon."
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.9.a: "It's not over yet."

 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.10.t: "OGAS is launched!"
 MAR_Kosygin_OGAS.10.d: "In a few days, the "OGAS" system was supposed to officially enter into operation, and the entire country was waiting for this moment with bated breath. The entire country except Glushkov. A sense of melancholy had been haunting him since the announcement of the date of full activation. However, now Viktor Mikhailovich had to go to a personal audience with the emperor. The doors of the cabinet opened and Alexei II greeted the incoming.\n\n"Hello, Viktor Mikhailovich," he began calmly. "Soon, OGAS should fully enter the life of our kingdom, and that is why I would like to talk to you in person."\n\n"Yes, hello, Alexei Nikola...Mikhailovich. Of course, I am ready to talk."\n\n"Tell me, Vitya, what is gnawing at you? After all, the whole country will soon see the miracle of automation. Wasn't that your dream?"\n\n"That was certainly it..." Viktor took off his glasses and nervously wiped them. "Only I'm afraid I couldn't do everything I wanted. Many ideas are simply impossible to realize."\n\n"I see..." with these words, the king stood up from his chair and approached Viktor. "You have already done more for people than any Marxist theorist or critic could have done in a lifetime. Don't blame yourself for what you couldn't do. Be happy that you were able to bring some things to life."\n\nThe conversation gradually turned to more business-like topics, but the conversation left a mark on Glushkov's state. He felt better. Perhaps this conversation was the one thing that was stopping him from taking the most difficult, final step."

 MAR_Kosygin_UAR.1.d:0 "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will remember this evening for a long time, as well as several others that preceded it. The trouble began when it turned out that Russian volunteers ended up on the same side as the Germans in Middle Eastern wars. This negatively affected relations with our allies in America and Asia, as in addition, we also opposed their interests. \n\nNow everyone at the Ministry is waiting anxiously for dispatches from the recently created United Arab Republic with proposals for mutual cooperation. But it never came. And it is unknown if it ever came to the Germans, because Berlin bureaucrats were playing poker perfectly. \n\n-Enough, it's time to take the initiative into our own hands. Before it's too late. I'm heading to Damascus right now. - that was the decision of the exhausted from lack of sleep Demichev. The next few hours passed by the phone and dictation of telegrams and letters. He fell asleep only on the plane."

Their leader Helmut Braun looked as if he was anticipating something. However, perhaps Peter was imagining things. A man in military uniform went up to the rostrum to announce the interim results. Apparently, everything was going in favor of Russia. \n\n“ATTENTION EVERYONE PRESENT,” This general's shout interrupted the murmurs of elderly Arab and European men. Instantly, all eyes were directed to the ceremonial door, where Salah Jadid was standing. “Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and his pack of rabid dogs just tried to storm the National Assembly! Armed with German rifles, they were arrested and disarmed, and Ahmed himself was taken into custody,” the general finished his speech with a gesture pointing at the German delegation. \n\nAfter these words, the German delegation protested and tried to confront the Russian delegation. But they were stopped by soldiers of the UAR army. Passing by the Russian delegation, Helmut scrutinized Peter, who was smiling."

Apparently, there was no clear advantage for either side. \n\n"ATTENTION EVERYONE PRESENT," this general's roar interrupted the murmurs of elderly Arabs and Europeans. Instantly, all eyes turned to the ceremonial door, where Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr stood with his personal guard. "The Russian delegation has been caught in actions against the republic! All its members must be immediately punished for attempting to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign state!", after which he gestured towards the Russian delegation. \n\nAlthough Peter understood that there would be no arrest, only expulsion back to Russia, it did not bring him any joy. Walking out accompanied by Ahmed's henchmen, Peter heard a mocking "Auf Wiedersehen!" from Helmut, probably.

Well, tell your masters that we do not intend to play by your rules," after which he gestured first towards the German, and a second later, towards the Russian delegation. \n\nAfter these words, the German and Russian delegations, completely forgetting about the presence of their Arab partners, pounced on each other. \n\n"The German side is trying to blame us!" \n\n"The general had information about your involvement too! The KGB made a mistake itself and is now trying to blame the German side!" \n\nThis argument could have led to a fight if it weren't for the sound of a Kalashnikov automatic rifle. After which, frightened diplomats were escorted out of the assembly.
