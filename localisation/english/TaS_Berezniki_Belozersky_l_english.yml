 MAR_pervii_ukaz_desc:0 "Now that Belozersky has become Tsar and the country has stabilized, he can start creating the first decrees. Once upon a time, we sacrificed working conditions in order to prepare the country for the struggle for Western Russia. Now that the battle for Western Russia has been won by us, it is worth thinking about how to make life easier for our workers. After all, they deserve it."

  berez_belozerski.1.d:0 "- Tsar, it's time to make the first decrees. What will you do?  The adviser asked.\n\n— Our first decree and our next step, respectively, my friend, will be the fulfillment of pre-election promises to the people. We promised to start developing the welfare of the people and now it's time to implement our idea.  Belozersky said with a certain tone of confidence.\n\n— Won't industrialists approve of such restrictions?  The adviser said with some disbelief. – After all, they are the ones who supported us at the Zemsky Sobor.\n\n— They didn't approve of us for that. In addition, our working conditions should not be critical for our nascent industry, and besides, they will not be very strong. Yes, we will lose productivity in factories in a certain sense, but workers are now suffering from overwork at their machines. The law that we issued before the Battle for Western Russia now applies to the whole of Western Russia, which should not work now, and at the moment there is no need for it. Therefore, we must resolve this issue.\n\n- As you say. I am ready to work with you.\n\nAfter a while, Belozersky carefully watched the ready-made decrees that his advisers had prepared. Many times he had to refuse certain decrees due to the dampness of their execution and demanded from his subordinates the introduction of clarifications and forced to polish every aspect of the issue to a shine. In the end, Belozersky finally said that these variants of the decree are worthy and can be published. Finally, he put a signature that will help increase the welfare of the population:"

Due to the fact that we do not have enough officials in our state, there is a problem with the administrative burden, which does not give us the opportunity to develop the country normally. Even the decree that we have issued is being implemented with great difficulties.\n\nDuring the era of warring generals on the territory of Western Russia, these same pseudo-leaders tried to create a semblance of a state. Any state, even one that can only formally claim the title of such, needs officials, and these militant generals have succeeded in this. Therefore, we must integrate into our ranks those officials who used to work for their masters, and with this step we will make it easier for ourselves to govern the country."

The mistake of 1917 is that the Tsar was too far from the people, and the lack of a real connection with him further weakened the political power of the state.\n\nWe will not allow this. Mladorossi ideology assumes that the people will also participate in the governance of the state. We must create a constitutional monarchical system with a parliament where the main parties of the country will be represented. Of course, not without some conditions..."

  berez_belozerski.2.d:0 "Despite the fact that we want to avoid the mistakes of 1917, we must understand that it is extremely undesirable for us to go to the other extreme. The power of the Tsar and the power of the people should complement each other, and not drag each other. It is quite obvious that if we create a parliament, it will weaken the position of the official authorities. However, we cannot do without it, because we will repeat the mistake of Tsar Nicholas II. Therefore, we need to make the process of creating parties in Parliament difficult. If necessary, very difficult.\n\nSo it was decided to prepare the creation of the parliament. Belozersky asked his Prime Minister Kazem-bek to start preparing the reform of the creation of the parliament. This is a difficult task that should be entrusted only to an experienced politician. No matter how strange it may sound, but Kazem-bek did not have to work for a long time, since he already had some blanks initially. He himself understands the necessity and the danger of parliament as such, and therefore he immediately made a bill.\n\nAccording to Kazem-bek's project, the parliament should be called the Supreme Council, consisting of 1,000 people, among whom 750 people should be representatives of the Mladorossi. The remaining 250 people are people who represent other political parties in the country. Moreover, political parties should be created in accordance with the law, which will be published in parallel with the law on the Supreme Council. According to the plan, in order to create a batch, it is necessary to fulfill a number of requirements, of which there are about 20 pieces. This will certainly complicate the task of creating a party that will be against the  Mladorossi.\n\nThe existence of such requirements will eventually lead to the creation of parties in the country that will be subordinate to the state. The presence of such parties will create the illusion of choice among citizens, when in fact there is none. Everything has already been decided.\n\nKazem-bek outlined the rights and duties of the Supreme Council. This authority can veto the laws of the Tsar, can itself put forward laws to Belozersky, propose ministers to the Tsar, and so on. But this is not enough. Kazem-bek proposed an option where Belozersky, in the event of a crisis of power, would have the opportunity to take power into his own hands and completely.\n\nBelozersky has already said his word. He knew who to entrust such an important job to, and he signed this bill with his \"approved\"."

These councils, that existed during Bukharin’s reign, were pretty good at managing economic problems in the local areas. Nonetheless these councils were extremely politicized and couldn’t act on their own, without the help of the state, which led to the economic collapse of the USSR. We need to account for this mistake and create new soviets that adhere to Mladorossi ideology. \n\nBut, even this matter can’t be solved so simply. There are some, who won’t appreciate the creation of these councils and can’t stand the term “soviet”. That’s why we need to find a way to create them in such a way that the people welcome them with open arms."
  berez_belozerski.3.t:0 "The New Soviets"
  berez_belozerski.3.d:0 "To create truly Mladorossistate, the next item is the creation of soviets. Councils are supposed to solve problems of a local nature, and they will be able to do this as long as they do not encounter a problem outside their competence. Our territories are vast and need additional reform to reduce administrative pressure on our state apparatus. In addition, we need this to create a constitutional people's monarchy, and in order to create a parliament, we need some kind of specific base – and this base will be found among these very councils.\n\nWe could simply introduce soviets, but there are certain difficulties with this. There is a whole group of people in the country who are ardent anti-communists, conservatives and reactionaries who do not tolerate this word. In their opinion, there should be no councils, or at best they should be very limited. Of course, there are few such people, but they do not understand that we will have other advice.\n\nBelozersky instructed Kazem-bek to start work on the bill, and he almost the next day provided a draft for the establishment of councils. They say that the Councils will be accountable to the population. This means that citizens will have the right to change their deputy if he does not satisfy their requests. The Councils are composed of citizens who are directly employed in production, that is, performing public and state duties along with their production activities. The status of a deputy is not a profession, but rather a related position. Elected officials who are separated from production are assigned a salary no higher than the average salary of a worker.\n\nThe whole plan seemed very compromising. However, Belozersky asked a question about the Councils that will form the Supreme Council. Who will be included there by party composition? Kazem-bek said without thinking twice that the soviets would have to consist of at least 2/3 of ruling party members, and in accordance with the laws on party registration, we can control the opposition. This way we will not lose the power and legitimacy of our government.\n\nBelozersky still decided to sign a version of the plan. It seems to be a compromise for all groups of the population, since everyone can be elected to the councils, but at the same time only those who have the right to vote – deputies from the council, and thus it turns out that we can satisfy the interests of both the people and reactionary groups."

First of all, this is characteristic of such regimes that have recently come to power and are trying to establish a solid foundation for their legitimacy – the support of the population. Unfortunately, there are many in our country who believe that it was better under Nicholas II than even now. This is partly true, but their blind faith in the now deceased Tsar undermines our legitimacy, and one could put up with this, if not the popularity of such trends. \n\nBelozersky contacted multiple printing magnates in order for him to commission the preparation of a series of articles on the topic of Nicholas II. In negotiations with these magnates, the Tsar-General set one condition – to expose all the troubles and all the failures of the reign of Nicholas II and show how bad he really was, for which he promised in the future to give them bonuses on behalf of the Tsar himself for a very large sum of money. In addition, in order to avoid what will happen after this growth of communist ideas, we will also have to blame the Bolsheviks and Lenin for the defeat of the Russian Empire in the First World War. \n\nAfter some time, the editors of these same newspapers were able to make several articles on this topic. If you read carefully, you can find a sharp criticism of the reign of Nicholas II and all his actions. Those things, the little that was good in the reign of this Tsar, were also turned into failures and failures, and everything was thrown off on Nicholas II. Many who managed to catch this time gave an ambiguous reaction, many of them were not happy that such a glorious time from their point of view was turned into a shameful one, but the bulk of the population believed in these main theses. Many articles that accused Nicholas II of incompetence ended with attacks on the Bolsheviks led by Lenin. The writers of the articles come to the conclusion that Lenin, instead of saving Russia from defeat in the war, only pushed it to the abyss, and thus they are also guilty of the fall of the empire. In total, it turns out that both Tsar Nicholas II himself and Lenin and his communist clique are to blame for the fall of Russia during this period of time. \n\nCommunists and conservative White Guard were left without the support of the population, and now the influence of these elements will significantly decrease."

  berez_belozerski.8.d:0 "Belozersky was collecting reports for the past month in order to make at least for himself some kind of complete picture of what is happening in the country. He rejoiced that since the unification of Western Russia, the state under his leadership began to rise and develop rapidly. One could only dream of such a thing under Bukharin, and indeed, everything was going quite well. At least as it could be seen from the reports.\n\nUntil Tretyakov Ivanovich, the chief clerk of the internal security of Western Russia, entered the office. Before that, of course, he asked permission to enter, to which he received a positive response. He entered quickly enough, even though he was holding a whole stack of reports from the order of the interior, on which there were about several dozen pencil underscores about the real state of affairs. Specifically, there were marked cases of rallies organized almost out of the blue for no particular reason.\n\nTretyakov reached the table and put this stack of reports next to the reports of other clerks.\n-- What is it? – Belozersky asked the question a few seconds later, clearly with an expression of incomprehension.\n— This, my Tsar, - said Tretyakov, picking up the topmost report and looking for notes that he had managed to make by this point – is the report. You know that we have trade unions in our country, right?\n-- Yes, I know, and let me guess – did you come on this issue? – Belozersky asked with some skepticism.\n- Exactly. Judging by these newspapers that I brought you, underground communist cells have been operating in our country for a long time. They undermine the situation in our country by not showing themselves in public and pretending to be only members of a trade union. Because of them, our industrialists are beginning to lose losses, and most importantly, they are beginning to push workers to commit revolutionary activities. Probably, this is the activity of Communists from the Western Front, who still did not accept defeat.\n-I suppose you want to do something about it – Belozersky asked a question.\n-- Yes, – said Tretyakov, - we need to fight this. We have a good experience of the past, specifically my colleague in the shop in the person of Zubatov. His activity shows that it is so easy to fight the communist threat that is lurking right now inside the trade unions.\"An interesting suggestion,\" said Belozersky, who was listening attentively to Tretyakov, \"I think I will allow you to start developing methods to combat this scourge.\n\nIt is very difficult to simply copy the \"zubatovism\" in this situation. The reason for this is that the trade unions, although they undermine the economy in this way, as a result, they do nothing beyond illegal. Therefore, we must do something else – register all trade unions and teach them not to act against the government or enterprises, but to try to achieve a compromise in negotiations. To do this, it is necessary to understand the difference between the workers' and the revolutionary movement: in the first case, the goal is a penny, in the second — an ideological theory. Such an explanation will allow our workers not to be provoked by these subversives of public opinion."

At the moment, this issue is very important, because overexpansion oppresses the state apparatus, which has only recently appeared relatively recently.\n\nBelozersky observes how some officials cannot cope with the amount of work they have. They have, if not thousands, then hundreds of papers that some officials cannot handle. This is due to the fact that the responsibilities of some ministers are too huge, while they have to work in more narrow specialties. What used to be necessary for ministers to work in many areas is now ineffective. We need to change this state of affairs.\n\nThe tsar, who wants his state apparatus to work more efficiently, instructed his friend Kazem bek to develop a draft reform of ministries. A few days later, Kazem-bek, after conferring with the current ministers, provided a version of the reform to Belozersky.\n\nReform by ministries, in general, solves the main problem of the administration – the workload of documents and the broad powers and responsibilities of ministries on various issues. They narrow down all these parameters significantly, and as a result, solve the problem with administrative workload. In order to further destroy this problem and facilitate the governance of the country as a whole, it was necessary to establish a number of new ministries that would have authority on certain issues in the state. For example, the Ministry of Digital Technologies and Communications will be established.\n\nBelozersky read and was impressed by the scope of the reform. However, he took a pencil and crossed out the inscription \"ministries\" with it, writing \"prikazy\" next to it. Kazem-bek raised his right eyebrow questioningly and frowned, clearly not understanding what Belozersky was doing. The tsar-general told him: \"If you remember, I promised people to return the good times of the strong people of Russia, and these times coincide with the reign of Ivan III the Great and Ivan IV. I think we should keep our promise.\" Kazem-bek, grinned a little with a questioning look, nevertheless, was forced to agree with the tsar's decision."

First of all, this is the creation of a special economic management body, the so–called Economic Order of the national Economy, which will be responsible for everything related to economic processes – industry, internal and external trade, taxes and so on. Secondly, his plan is that we should develop the country's economy not only on our own, but also by attracting investments from outside. Special emphasis is placed here on the creation of heavy industry, which will produce military products.\n\nIn parallel with all this, we need to solve a lot of other, equally important issues, such as: education, small and medium-sized businesses, agricultural development and much more.

Olga devoted her whole life to children. Unfortunately, she was not destined to have her own. But instead, she found her vocation in helping other people's children. For more than 30 years, she has been helping children learn about the world around them in one way or another. At first she helped children in Adygea, and later even in Kirov. But as the Germans came, everything became much worse. There were not enough schools beyond the Ural Mountains, there were no tools, there was too little of everything.\n\nThe teacher tilted her head, those most terrible memories began to come. A convoy going into an impenetrable blizzard, sharp sounds of planes overhead, explosions of shells... So vividly the image of Sveta, a 5-year-old girl who was wounded by bomb explosions, popped up in my head. The face of Vanya, who at best got crumbs from food, but who still went to work at the machine, at one point Olga stopped seeing him going to work in the morning ... Tears began to flow down the woman's face, she remembered what she could not forgive herself for. What happened there, in Siberia... Thoughts were confused in my head, as if trying to delay this moment. But even out of this confusion, she could clearly hear the voice. "Olga Viktorovna, can I come out?" Valera told her. She did not know that it would be then that the plane would fly, she did not know that it was not safe beyond the mountains, she did not know, could not know.\n\n-"Olga Viktorovna, is everything with you..." Tanya, one of the wards, timidly asked, interrupting the memory of her thoughts. \n-"Yes... I'm fine, it just got a little bad, I'll be right back," the woman replied. And so she was going to the toilet when her legs began to give way. Fortunately, the physical education teacher turned out to be close and helped to get there. Having calmed down, the woman again plunged into thoughts. She is back at school, and there is enough in school again, and again you can teach children, hear their laughter. Maybe we should finally let go of the past and go forward, together with our students..."

So, for example, we, being the same size as field generals, had rare ties with the United States. Nevertheless, the Russians have not had full-fledged ties for a long time. In addition, our state, even now united, has not yet opened diplomatic ties with the outside world, and although many countries already know perfectly well that we exist, no one is trying to establish contacts with us.\n\n We have to establish our diplomatic relations with the outside world ourselves, but first of all we have to create an Embassy Order from scratch, which will have to deal with the establishment of foreign policy relations."

Peering at the map of the world, he calculated in his head, as if at a chessboard, all the variants of events of certain actions on the world stage. In his head, a logical chain of actions of his country was being built, which would eventually lead to elevation. It was no secret to anyone that Belozersky planned not only to strengthen the country from within, but also in a foreign policy way – by expanding the Mladorossi state to the west, to Germany and to the east, to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThere is a problem - although he imagined himself at the geopolitical chessboard, he did not have any pieces – he was not really in this game at all. No one wants to cooperate with the Mladorossi state, at least because we are underestimated, and at most because few people realized that we were reborn from the ashes at all. This fact is very offensive for Belozersky.\n\nExactly! Foreign ministers. We need to create our own Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to be more precise, an Embassy Order, which will be engaged in establishing diplomatic relations with other countries. It is only necessary to create the Embassy Order itself. And even though the First Congress of Soviets adopted a plan for the foreign policy development of our country, nevertheless, it was necessary to start implementing it sooner or later anyway.\n\nBelozersky entrusted the work of creating an Embassy Order to Kazem-bek, and he, in turn, began to gather the people he needed, who would become the first ambassadors to the states and begin to establish ties with potential allies. First of all, on behalf of Belozersky himself, the ambassadors will go to OFN countries – to the USA, Canada and other such countries. Kazem-bek selects people based on how educated they are, whether they speak the right languages, whether they are polite enough and whether they comply with a number of criteria that a good diplomat needs.\n\nEventually he was able to find the right people. The first ambassadors and diplomats began to prepare for service abroad. Our country must come out of diplomatic isolation and contact the outside world. And we will definitely do it soon."

Indeed, iron ore, which was exported from Russia, is really 1.5 times cheaper than Australian, and 3 times cheaper than Canadian. With all this, it is quite realistic that the quality of iron is high and generally competitive with Western analogues.\n\nHe had iron reserves for another 3 months ahead, but he decided to request the purchase of iron now, because approximately during the delivery of the cargo, the iron reserves would run out, and he would have to wait for the delivery of a new cargo for a long time.

Who would have thought that Sergei's fate would turn so abruptly and he would become the tsar of Russia.\n\nBelozersky wanted to build up diplomatic relations with the United States not so much even for pragmatic reasons, as for these very nostalgic motives. The tsar pondered – how can relations with the States be improved further? He wanted to improve them even more. However, after looking at the work of his diplomats, he, let's say, became sad, due to the fact that business on building relations is extremely slow.\n\nThere is such a saying - if you want to do well, do it yourself. Belozersky will do so – he will go to the United States himself and personally talk to the American president. It is in a personal conversation that he will talk everything over with the president and thereby accelerate the building of relations, and most importantly, it will give additional opportunities for Mladorossi Russia.\n\nHaving agreed on a meeting with the President through his ambassadors, he flew to Washington on a transatlantic plane. After almost a day of flight, he found himself in the US capital, where he went from the airport in a motorcade to the White House. The meeting was scheduled at a strictly defined time and Belozersky was ideally on the spot by this time. When the motorcade finished its journey, the doormen opened the door for the Tsar and the White House guards greeted him. Belozersky was escorted inside the White House and he entered the president's office.\n\nThe President and Belozersky started a conversation.

At the beginning of the conversation, Sergey introduced himself to the president, telling briefly about his life and he paid special attention to the American service. He planned to devote about half an hour to this, and in half an hour other topics of communication were also touched upon. Judging by the way the president listened to Belozersky, he was impressed by the adventures of the still young Sergei. Having achieved the necessary predisposition to communicate on more serious topics, the Tsar began a conversation about cooperation with the United States and the OFN in general.\n\nBelozersky asked the President to simplify the process of building relations between the US and Western-Russian People`s Kingdom, Russia to attract to the work of foreign specialists in the military and economic spheres, and, in addition, conclude agreements directed against German and other-other agreement.\n\nThe discussion of all these conditions went faster than it would have been with the ambassadors of the two countries, but the president was careful in his statements. Belozersky, using all his oratory and fueling interest in the topic with possible benefits for the OFN, he was able to achieve all the desired agreements that he wanted to achieve with the United States. This whole meeting lasted longer than it was planned until 3 PM.

Vasily ordered his men to prepare to meet their American colleagues and gave permission to dock in Arkhangelsk.\n\nThe ships finally stopped near the ports, and the unloading equipment that was in Arkhangelsk began to pull out boxes with new machines. Every worker looked at these boxes with trepidation, trying to figure out what was inside. Some of the other ships were carrying people who looked like military men. These were military specialists invited by Belozersky himself to train Russian soldiers in hand-to-hand combat, tactical techniques and generally improve the skills of our fighters. As soon as these specialists left the ships, they were picked up by a military truck, which was taken, apparently, to a military unit, where they already began to deal directly with matters within their competence.\n\nAs soon as the unloading of the ships was over, Vasily received a report about it and sent the report to his boss up to the trade clerk.

And then our military campaign will be doomed to failure.\n\n Our plan is to weaken the Reichskommissariat from within as much as possible. Russian people, most likely, also want liberation, and therefore we should take advantage of this situation by sending our agents of influence and inciting Russian soldiers in the RK to mutiny and disobedience, and in order to do this, we must make a small safe corridor with the help of a border skirmish in the place where it will be most convenient for our agents of influence to pass. Thus, we can still look at what tactics the enemy uses against us and assess their overall combat readiness.\n\n The plan on paper is extremely simple, but it has a complex implementation. Our plan is audacious, and nevertheless necessary, to probe the enemy by force. Perhaps this will lead to the fact that Germany will be the first to attack us from such an audacious attack, but they have long received and are still receiving reports about the dead border guards on the eastern borders of their Reich, and therefore they will most likely miss the next report on the attack and will not pay attention."

However, in order to liberate the rest of Western Russia, we need not only people on the fronts, but also people in the rear. Until now, partisans are operating on the territory of the Nazi sphere of influence, who are waging a desperate struggle to exterminate opponents like the same Germans, and this hatred of the Nazi invaders unites everyone - Russians, Little Russians, Poles and even Jews and other peoples who are now groaning under the heel Nazis.\n\nIt would be wise for us to help our guerrillas, and some even to help set up a government in exile. Belozersky instructed his people in orders to create departments for helping partisans outside the Mladorossky state and to create a department for governments in exile, and first of all to convene here the ambassadors of the Polish Republic, which refused to obey the Nazis.\n\nThese ambassadors came to Russia and they began to establish diplomatic relations with our country. There can be no talk of any economic agreements, but these are political acts - Russia has pledged to help Poland regain its independence after liberation from the Nazi occupiers. The ambassadors of the Polish Republic in exile were very pleased that they had just acquired new allies in us and that they would not be in debt in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, while the ambassadors were establishing relations with us, we created a department for communications and coordination of our partisans in Eastern Europe. We contacted, if not all, then at least the largest partisan cells that operate on the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and, of course, in Muscovy. Using the holes in the border of Muscovy, we can transport part of our equipment there, to the east, and coordinate the actions of these partisan detachments so that they strike where we need them first.\n\nThanks to our connections, we learned the true state of affairs in the Reich - the situation of the slaves is frankly hopeless, and the people are just as ready to rise up to fight the invaders.

This often happened after school, when everyone had already gone home. These brawlers, after a not very good day because of bad grades, vented their anger on this boy.n\nAnd so it was again on this day, when he once again went home. Trying to fight back, he was quickly knocked to the ground. These teasers were saying, "Ha! Weakling! And what are you going to do to us?!", "You silly little thing, you're funny when you're helpless!" and all that sort of thing. Helpless anger was in this boy, who could not just get to his feet and give a decisive rebuff. He would have wanted to do it himself, but he just couldn't. Specifically, we were lucky today, there were two of them, because two more went somewhere in an unknown direction.\n\nThis went on for at least a minute until a massive schoolboy arrived. Outwardly, it seemed that he was clearly stronger than both of them, and this man, out of an obvious noble sense of helping the weaker ones, shouted to these guys:\n\n- Get out of here! Get away from him, or I'll hit you! I'm hitting hard!\n\nFrightened by the surprise of any help from such a person, and seeing that he was really stronger than both of them, they left in silence.\n\nAs soon as they turned around, this massive man, as it turned out, was also a third grader, helped him up.

His family was one of those who owned large plots of land, and therefore, in order to cultivate all this, his family hired other peasants to work for them. They were called "Kulaks". Maxim found a short time of prosperity, which could be earned either by his own labor, or by the hired labor of others.\n\nHowever, this time quickly ended, and when he turned 18, the father of the family instructed Maxim to monitor the household until he returned home, because the war with the Bolsheviks had begun. Nevertheless, my father has not yet returned, and may have died a long time ago in Siberia, fighting on the side of Kolchak, but we will never know for sure. As soon as the Bolsheviks came to these lands, it immediately became much more difficult for the "kulaks" to live, eventually collectivization began in 1928, where the Kulak farm was selected in favor of the collective farm.\n\nMaxim did not resist the Bolsheviks, but he regretted that his land was taken and taken away so easily, and besides, it was very unfair, as he himself believes: he was on good terms with other peasants, but the law was the law – it was necessary to collectivize all farms. Since then, he also worked on the collective farm for a long time, but suddenly there was a war that destroyed those new orders.\n\nThe Great Patriotic War destroyed Bukharin's Soviet Union, but the collective farms as a whole were still functioning until the second collapse occurred – the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed, and a new state was already in place where Maxim's collective farm was, and it was disbanded. The land was not returned.\n\nOnly with the arrival of Mladorossi, the situation has changed here. Finally, having received his own allotment of land equal to what it was before, he could again cultivate everything himself, but he was already extremely old for this. I didn't have enough strength, my joints ached, everything hurt, but my hands still remembered how to work properly. And yet, he understood that he alone would not be able to master such a large field, and therefore he again turned to younger, but poor peasants, and offered them to work for him in the field, and he said that everyone would receive remuneration for their work without fail. The peasants agreed to help him cultivate the land.\n\nGrandfather was finally calm, he again received a guarantee that he would not live in poverty in peace. All his children and grandchildren are in the cities now, but they can't help their grandfather right now. Now the grandfather can take care of himself, because the old skills of managing the household will help him survive, or even get rich again. Apparently, we are witnessing the rise of new "kulaks"."

All his information about what was going on there was reduced to newspaper lines of weekly news about Russia. As an ardent anti-communist, he hated the Soviet Union, but he empathized with the fate of his homeland, no matter what. And he experienced great grief when he learned that the USSR was destroyed in the Great Patriotic War, and after the final collapse of Russia, he completely fell into despondency. After these events, newspaper lines about Russia were extremely scarce and abrupt, from which he could only draw one simple conclusion: Russia had disappeared.\n\nHowever, he was extremely surprised when he found out in another newspaper publication that Russia had begun to recover.

Therefore, for a simpler appeal in this case, they decided to call this thug a Hammer-breaker. \n\nThose who suffered, but did not die, cannot give clear testimony about who did it. There are no assumptions about why this person commits attacks on ordinary citizens in general, because citizens rarely carry something more expensive than 100-150 rubles, therefore, only extremely narrow-minded criminals can commit such attacks.

After a few more minutes, she entered the office, next to which there was a sign, clearly referring to the fact that the district police officer's name was Leonid Kanevsky. \n\nThe teacher gave a notebook to Kanevsky and told the circumstances of the discovery. Kanevsky began to read this notebook first, and he was immediately struck by what was written on the first pages. The inscription was like this: "Red Brigades – for true communism!", where the letter M was written a little lower due to the fact that there was not enough space. A star with a swastika was drawn in the center of the entire drawing, which clearly gives an idea of what this notebook is all about. Outwardly, the notebook was a little worn, but the text was written very smoothly and almost without any typos and grammar errors. Some lines especially strongly catch the eye:\n\n"... Mladorossi of Kazem-bek, together with Tsar Sergei Belozersky, are not real carriers of Russian spirituality, hiding under the guise of "Russianness", they strive to combine the best socialist ideas with delusional monarchical rudiments of the past..."\n\n"... This government was supported by naive people who believe that they can return in such an easy way to the well-being that they lost under the tsars, under Bukharin and others. They naively believe that this path is easy because it is right. This is far from the case. Russian Russian nation's true path of development lies through "left fascism", a mixture of Russian identity and socialism, which glows in the depths of the Russian consciousness..."\n\n"... To achieve far-reaching goals, all means are good: bribery, blackmail, murder, military terror, agitation and propaganda among the masses. The idea of the "Red Brigades" is to include their people in the state apparatus of the existing regime in order to build a truly Russian-communist party...\n\nKanevsky was stunned. In addition, there is a lot of speculation about the "magic number" 36. He did not read this notebook much anymore, and he told the school teacher that he would sort out the whole thing. Leonid decided to give the notebook immediately to the local department of the MSS that same day. Graphological examination shows that the text was written by an adult. Immediately after that, the version that the student wrote it disappears. However, it was necessary to figure out where this notebook still got to school. A preventive conversation was immediately held with the students of the school, the results of which revealed that no one has any mental inclinations or dissident thoughts.

I demand from you to immediately strengthen patrols, strengthen surveillance, investigate all currently released criminals! Do everything to stop him!\n\nEverything he said was done. In order to further support the work of his patrols, he personally drives a company car with the others in order to find the same hammer fighter as quickly as possible. Kanevsky's determination was firm, and he wanted at all costs to catch this bully, wherever he was.\n\nOne afternoon, a police patrol headed by Leonid himself was driving around. They drove and peered into the crowd of people. At first it seemed that there would be absolutely nothing interesting to discover there. However, the gaze was riveted on one pair of men who were standing somewhat apart from everyone else. The first man had a briefcase, the second was without everything.

I'm going after the runner!\n- The first one, on my way! \n\nThe second car stopped on the road next to the man and he was immediately tied up and sent to the police station. The first one, where Kanevsky was, was driving fast behind a running man. However, it didn't work out to chase him for a long time, because he literally ran around the corner and disappeared obviously in an unknown direction. It would be possible to wander around the area for an extremely long time, and during this time he would run out of the chain.\n\nReturning to the man with the briefcase, we immediately decided to inspect this briefcase. There was a club in the briefcase, tied with some rags with blood. Trying to unwind the rags to understand the device of a homemade club, blood flowed from there. The briefcase also contained the manifesto of the "Red Brigade". The manifesto was exactly identical to the one given by the school teacher of the 127th school. However, the man himself was an absolutely unremarkable driver of the production department. So much so that even at first they did not believe at all that he could be the killer of 36 victims. And he confessed that he really didn't commit the murder.\n\nHe gave evidence and a tip to his friends and buddies. Attention was attracted by someone named Viktor Osipov, who was a huge guy under two meters tall. It became almost obvious that it was he who was the hammerer. He was immediately also taken under arrest and began to beat out testimony from both, because Kanevsky was absolutely sure that neither Viktor Osipov nor the driver of the department could be the "think tanks" of the "Red Brigade".

The staff asked for his name, but the boy only said his last name – Empty.\n\nA little confused, Kanevsky asked the boy to tell him where his brother Alexey was. He said that he was at home, and he indicated the apartment number, after which the staff immediately began to go to him.\n\nLater, a small preparation for the storming of Alexei's house began.

But immediately his tone changed to a more businesslike one and he ordered the staff to collect all the documents and data that could be collected from his room. Later, Vladimir's personal diary was taken away, from which we can only learn that he was bullied as a child and at school for being short and for wearing glasses. Apparently, this prompted him to embark on the path of destroying all the old regimes in order to build a new, ideal one, as he believes.\n\nThe meaning of the number 36 is also explained – this magic number means the sum of the numbering of letters in the Russian alphabet, and he compared his name with Bonaparte, who also came out, according to Pustov's calculations, the number 36.\n\nIt is obvious that the leader of the "Red Brigades" was killed, and it remains only to publish the news that a gang of "Hammers", who, as it turns out, called themselves "Red Brigades", was liquidated. Pustovit obviously admired Hitler, Napoleon, and dreamed of conquering the world, but the only thing he has in common with tyrants is how he ended his life like them, who thought they had every right to direct the destinies of the lives of the whole world."

 berez_belozerski.34.d:0 "The strongest squad of the Black League that remained after its defeat was Lazarenko's squad. His squad was one of the many fragments of the Black League that remained after their defeat. Lazarenko's detachment was located approximately where the center of the entire Black League was once, but it was forced to be in areas where there are at least some forests in order to hide from a direct clash with its enemies.\n\nAlexander Lazarenko, despite all his baggage of skills, owned a squad that, although it seemed quite capable to itself, in fact had in its composition gnawed tatters, which half of them were not dressed properly. His efforts to improve logistics within his squad improved the situation from hopeless to better, nevertheless, a number of objective reasons did not change the situation in the bud. Many did not have Black League bandages, as the fabric was used for bandages. On the faces of some, hunger brought them to the point that they had black circles under their eyes, and someone simply collapsed from exhaustion. The armament also left much to be desired, the squad was armed with a variety of weapons, ranging from outdated PPSH-41, ending with something AK-47-like assault rifles. The only thing that distinguished them from the bandits was the presence of an entire T-34-85 tank, which certainly could pose a serious danger to the rest. And yet, what exactly cannot be taken away from the soldiers of the Black League is their fighting spirit and desperate determination to fight for their idea.\n\nThe pRadists of his squad are trying to keep in touch with other squads, smaller and very weak in comparison with his squad. However, every day there are fewer and fewer detachments that still get in touch, until the connection is completely cut off. In the language of the Black League detachments, this means that they either went missing or were destroyed, and by whom it is difficult to say, because recently the Young Russians have come here, at least as rumors are heard from beyond the Urals, the pathetic remnants of the "Batovites" have also become active, which do not pose any danger to the Young Russians.As soon as the soldiers arrived, they began to form up in a line of four, while the cadets stood behind Lazarenko. When everyone gathered, he began his speech, which he had been trying to work out in his head for a long time so that it sounded truthful, but fiery:\n\n"Comrades of the black league! Our scouts reported that an army of Young Russians was moving in our direction. Our squad was the very last of all who remained alive. Our comrades died fighting the traitors of the Motherland to the last drop of blood. Our brothers sacrificed their lives so that our motherland would atone for the sins of the past! And we remained the last stronghold of the Black League, the last chance to save our great Motherland!\n\n Our idea of the redemption of Russia lives in the hearts of people, and only thanks to us our cause has not yet perished. I have to tell you that tomorrow will be the most important day for all of you. Tomorrow – there will be a fight. Perhaps the last, but extremely important for all our future generations. Let the whole of Russia know that we have not bowed our heads! We will not obey anyone, neither the Young Russians, nor the Communists, nor the Batovians! Let the whole of Russia know that we have not given up! That we fought for the cause of our children, our brothers, our sisters and mothers, that we fought for our land, for our home, and for every Russian person!\n\nEnemy will not show us mercy. So let it! We will respond with tenfold hatred for our opponents! They will pay tenfold for our death, we will either win here, or we will die free and unconquered! Long live the Black League!"\n\n"And now get to work. Tomorrow is the decisive day! Dig trenches, they will become your fortress or your grave..." - Lazarenko said finally."

 berez_belozerski.35.d:0 "Belozersky decided to take a walk through the new territories that were annexed relatively recently. We need to take a break from work, which has already tired us during this time. Together with his guards, he went to Tyumen, as one of the largest cities in Western Siberia. In the end, he, as the owner of this land, had to look at the newly conquered territories with his own eyes, and so he decided to kill two birds with one stone at once. \n\nThe question of what Tyumen looks like in architectural terms is of great interest to him. As he was informed, earlier in Tyumen there was a government of Kaganovich, a socialist who supported the little-known Joseph Stalin in the struggle against Nikolai Bukharin. How would history have gone if Stalin had more strength and he would have defeated Bukharin? Belozersky thought about this moment, not even paying attention to what majestic buildings were erected in Tyumen. Belozersky could only imagine the consequences of such a scenario, where Joseph Stalin became the leader of a huge country of Soviets. Perhaps the story ended more tragically even for the Russian people than under Bukharin. It is possible that the story would be the same as in our reality. What if it would have been different? What if in that parallel reality the Russian people were able to defeat the Nazis? I'm afraid to imagine how it would look, and from such a thought, the spirit is taken away from the majesty and captivates from the fear of what place he would take in this world. Fortunately or unfortunately, fate decreed quite differently. Speaking about the city itself, the architecture of all these buildings causes pride for the Russian people, who were able to build it even under a hail of Nazi bombs. Tall houses are a luxury even for the capital of Belozersky, not to mention the provinces. However, all these buildings pale in front of a seemingly clearly inferior architectural structure - the Lenin Mausoleum. Belozersky's attention was riveted to this building, since it was remarkable in itself among others, and what was there was literally the mummified body of Lenin, the man who created the revolution, and in fact laid the foundation for the future for Russia. Thoughts of Stalin and Bukharin were smoothly replaced by thoughts of Vladimir Ilyich, and he even said with a certain cynicism in his head that if it weren't for this man, none of this would have happened. At least, as he could reason. If it were not for him and his party, then in the distant 60s Belozersky would not have become the tsar of Great Russia, which is now beginning to rise from its knees. If it had not been for him, there would have been neither the same Stalin nor the same Bukharin, and if it had not been for them, there would have been no what happened in the Great Patriotic War, there would have been no Battle for Western Russia, there would have been no victory of the Young Russian Dream in Russia. There would be nothing. Belozersky watched as this mausoleum was slowly being dismantled, because they decided to dismantle it and build a new house in its place, and it was decided to bury Lenin's body with a calm soul. Belozersky did not prevent them from doing this, and he drove on through Tyumen."

We have to admit that he made some of the best machine guns on the territory of Russia, since every highly respected field commander had to have a weapon from Zlatoust to fight his opponents, which suggests that he is a recognized master with golden hands throughout Russia.This man and his team found themselves on the territory of the Tsarist Union, and we are obliged to use their services so that they continue to develop weapons, but only for our army.

Only this allowed them to survive in such a complex economic ruin and anarchy after the defeat in the Great Patriotic War.\n\nS On the other hand, they cannot be called "heroes of our time". Yes, their talent is undeniable, however, what were these skills spent on? They went for weapons that were sold to pseudo-rulers of Russia, who killed other Russians subordinate to other pseudo-rulers. If it is possible to say what they are guilty of, it is that they aided the robbery on the territory of Russia.\n\no the most correct definition that can be given to them is that they are scoundrels against their will. They did not choose their own fate, it was their life that forced them to switch to such a way of existence, and they got out of it, like many millions of Russians, as best they could. However, times have changed, more favorable times have come for Dragunov's people, which contribute to favorable work, and we want to invite them, no matter what, to our design bureaus.\n\Nbelozersky personally offered Dragunov a job in the design bureau by phone. He promised to provide them with everything necessary for them to start work and do it effectively. Dragunov expressed his gratitude without further discussion and agreed to a new job. For many people, Dragunova is not only the only way to live, but also something like a hobby, and therefore he could not just refuse in front of the tsar himself with his proposal."

When he arrived, he got out of the car and entered the White House, and after a fairly short conversation with the President, he almost immediately began talking about politics.Belozersky proposed to the President a new package of trade agreements with the United States and the OFN countries, saying that now Russia can supply more resources, since now the Young Russians own new territories with their natural resources, and in addition, he further proposes to increase the supply of necessary goods to the Tsarist Union. The US President said that these agreements can be concluded and therefore he agrees.Following this, Belozersky proposed to sign a non-aggression pact between the OFN countries and the Tsarist Union. This pact is important in the language of diplomacy, since by such a pact countries sign that the countries of the signing parties agree to resolve all disputed issues only by peaceful means. In fact, this is a very reasonable step for Belozersky in the long term. In the future, if everything goes well, Russia will be able to put forward its demands on Eastern Europe frankly without fear that the United States will use weapons in disputes with us.\n\nHowever, the American president did not immediately accept this agreement. He sees it all perfectly, but after thinking about it, he still decided to agree and sign this non-aggression treaty with the Tsarist Union. Belozersky could only guess what the American president was thinking at that moment. Are the Americans not so supportive of us?

Trenches were dug, reserve lines of defense were prepared to be used when necessary. The last line of defense of the Black League was not far from the bank of the Irtysh - there was a command post. The cadets, who were still in training schools, carried out the work strictly as a textbook, but also created their own billets in order to strike a surprise blow. The T-34-85 took a favorable position for firing from convenient positions - it could not be deliberately sent into battle because its armor was not enough to fight other tanks of the enemy. \n\nNow, from the binoculars, the Mladoros were detected. They knew they would have the most serious unit against them, so they did not act as guerrilla squads, but as an army. The cadets were surprised at how coherently the troops of the "general czar" attacked. And that amazement was replaced by shock when artillery strikes were heard in the forest. A hail of shells fell on the defenders of this forest, and the troops of the first line of defense had to retreat with losses.nWhen the Mladorosses entered the forest, they continued to advance without stopping and destroyed those units that were still in position. It was a hard battle in the woods, where the black Leaguers showed all their anger and hatred toward their enemies. Only spirit determined whether a fighter would survive or not. But no matter what, the Mladorosses squeezed through the enemy defenses. Only a few, the few whose spirits were broken, surrendered at the mercy of the Tsarist Alliance troops.T-34-85s, which were in a good position, finally began to show their full firepower. Having knocked out several of the light vehicles, it was supposed to start changing positions, but the RPG-7 hit the turret of the tank. The small amount of ammunition in his possession was detonated. This also detonated the fuel tanks, which ignited the tank. You could hear the tank crews screaming in pain as they burned alive. The tank, laden with additional camouflage such as branches and bushes began to burn, and with it the camouflage it was wearing. Eventually, the size of the flames grew to unbelievable proportions, igniting the trees and starting a forest fire. While all this was going on, the Mladorossian troops were digging deeper and deeper into the Black League defenses until they reached the command headquarters in the same way. Lazarenko and his last soldiers were preparing to take the last battle. To die from the smoke of fire is perhaps one of the ignominious deaths for the Black League, so the decision was made to launch a counterattack by all available forces against the Mladorosses. \n\nLazarenko and his last soldiers rose at full height with the Black League banner in their hands and, to the deafening cry of "Hurrah!", went into hand-to-hand combat with machine guns, knives, and spades against the superior Mladorossian forces. The flag bearer caught his banner in the forest fire and his banner began to catch fire. Later, during the attack, this same man died, falling, and his half-burned flag fell to the ground. It's a sad ending for the Black League. \n\nLazarenko and his fighters died showing high courage and bravery in the course of the battle, all of them dead.

But as soon as the money stops flowing into the project, the project will slow down, and the weapons will be obtained much later than we could ever expect. Otherwise, there are no major difficulties, except that we would have to get more scientific personnel to work on the project. It was also noted that there was very serious help in the form of state-of-the-art instrumentation to enable accurate calculations.{nInGil took note of all this, and the scribe wrote down all the questions and answers so he could report later that the first phase of Project Grozny was close to completion, and there were only weeks until the official transition to the next phase was under way."

Of course, there is oil and some other precious resources there, but for Russia specifically, this would be just another drop in the sea of an already rich Russia. However, the value of Central Asia lies primarily in its geopolitical location - it is literally our open southern flank, from which it is convenient to attack the territory of our country.\n\nIn order to protect our country, we can offer nothing better than capturing Central Asia. This is the most proven option for Russia, since the creation of a collaborationist regime there might be riskier than a direct military invasion. Above all, however, we must invade Kazakhstan, which is our neighbor to the south. From there we can act both toward Siberia and toward the south, for a further offensive into Central Asia."

If we start rebuilding the region without an established power, we just won't get anywhere, and that's why we need to make the Mladoros branches in Kazakhstan, which include Kazakhs and the Russian-speaking population."

In general, there is much that speaks in support of this thesis, and the most striking proof of this is the organizational work of the Mladoross party. It was he, in fact, who organized the whole work of the party, and later the whole country. And although he is only now Prime Minister, the importance of this person for the party cannot be overestimated. Without him there wouldn't have been the Mladorossov party.He was a skilled organizer, and Serghei Belozersky saw it well, and he perfectly understood that Kazem-Bek's talents can still be useful. And he needed them now more than ever, because just a few weeks ago Kazakhstan became part of the Tsarist Union, and he needed to establish the power of the Mladorosses there. To do this, he intended to use Alexander to organize everything there from scratch, so that everything would work. Why exactly in this way? There is no normal civil and party power in Kazakhstan right now, there is only a military occupation there, which means that you have to build the power there essentially from scratch. On a clean field, like the steppes of Kazakhstan itself.Belozersky entrusted this job to Kazem-Bek, and he took this responsible job not to say with great enthusiasm. Assignment of such a job means that Alexander will have to do the work he was doing at the very dawn of the Mladoross party, that is, literally speaking, to create the party from scratch. And besides, he would have to move away from the capital directly to Kazakhstan, perhaps to Pavlodar, as the most developed city, in order to cope more effectively with his assigned task. He wasn't too upset, though, because his deputy would replace him for the time being.So Kazem-Bek went to Kazakhstan to build the party work there from scratch. We have to find supporters, spread the ideology, incorporate new members, create councils from scratch, and so on and so forth..."."

These people, who are far away from their own home, can find this new home only here, in Kazakhstan, so they can fight for our country against the Nazis for the liberation of their native land.

The result was a pretty tolerable plan of economic development for this region.\n\nKosygin sent this Kazakh plan to Pavlodar, where Kazem-Bek was at the moment. And the moment he read this plan from scratch, he was somewhat surprised. First of all, he was surprised that in principle he still had to do something other than party work. Secondly, he was surprised at the very large amount of money planned to be spent in Kazakhstan. The money is pretty solid, I should say, but the plan was designed primarily for the long term, and therefore it could pay off in the future.

It's worth mentioning that because they are literally made often by feet, they quickly become muddy in bad weather and prevent us from developing this region further.\n\nIn this context, it makes sense to develop not only the urban infrastructure, but also the road infrastructure. It can give a powerful economic boost to development, because the processes will be accelerated. We have to invest in the creation of new high-quality asphalt and railroads. And this will give us a good impetus for the further development of this region. \n\nIn addition, it also makes sense to develop the existing roads - to rebuild the old roads, to repair them, and even just this will give a strong impetus to the development of the region.

Some were embarrassed by the fact that now they would have to write only in Russian.Nonetheless, some were frightened by this fact and some quit the administration because they simply could not speak Russian. Some people, on the contrary, were inspired to start learning Russian and many of them learned it right in the "combat situations". With great difficulty, with trivial spelling errors, and other problems, such Kazakhs still managed to learn a little Russian at a basic level, in order to write anything and work in the administration. Others were immediately involved in effective work, but it took them a long time to get used to filling out documents on new forms.nnUnRussian administrators who came to Kazakhstan to monitor the quality of administrative work, the first time many documents were sent back for revision - there were problems with fonts, line spacing, spacing between the borders of the sheet and other shortcomings.
