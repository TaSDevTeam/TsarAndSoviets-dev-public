 MAR_united_and_indivisible_desc:0 "Finally, this moment has arrived. Despite all circumstances, despite numerous obstacles in our path, we have achieved the impossible - we have united our great Motherland, and the proud imperial flag flies in every city.\n\nThere is still much work ahead of us: we are threatened with \"violent pacification\" by the Nazis in the West, the Japanese in the East have firmly gripped our historical lands, and the territory of Siberia is torn by popular unrest, but today we will celebrate; let the vodka flow like a river."
 MAR_allrussian_mladorossi_party_desc:0 "Our Mladorossi Party had its humble beginnings in a small town - Berezniki. At that time, our association was just a small spot on the territory of the former Soviet state, but over time we began to expand more and more. Soon, the entire Western Russia was under the full control of our party, and later Western Siberia as well. Now, the entire Russia, free from German invaders, is in the hands of the Mladorossi. We need to reflect this in the life of our party; it is worth accepting ardent supporters of our regime from the Siberian and Far Eastern lands."
 MAR_partisan_problem_desc:0 "Despite the fall of the last regime competing with us on the territory of Russia, not all people are yet ready to accept our state into their hearts. On the conquered territories, centers of resistance to the Mladorossi are emerging. Groups of dissatisfied radicals, like a rash on the body, have become widespread and, despite their relative small numbers, pose a certain threat to our regime. We must suppress them at the very beginning; let us task the MGB and Gil with this mission."
 MAR_siberian_amnesty_desc:0 "On the liberated lands of Russia, there once existed many state formations. Some of them were little different from bandits who had lost their human essence, but others had rudimentary features of a strong state. In any case, these states have sunk into oblivion; now the flag of the Mladorossi flies in their place. But despite the disappearance of their governments, key figures remain in place and are currently in prison. It would be very wasteful on our part to squander such valuable personnel, especially considering that some of them have declared their intentions to cooperate with us."
 MAR_international_recognition_desc:0 "For the further implementation of our plan, we need to secure support abroad. The states that are part of the Unity Pact and the Sphere of Co-Prosperity are our main adversaries; it would be foolish to expect cooperation between us. However, the OSN countries are more than friendly towards us; they are ready to provide us with feasible assistance in the fight against the fascist scum.\n\nWe will develop these relations gradually; for starters, we will send our Minister of Foreign Affairs on a tour of the OSN countries, demanding that they recognize our state as the sole successor to the Russian Empire."
 MAR_tour_of_russia_desc:0 "Monarchy has historically been a very important institution in our country. The fate of our great Motherland is closely linked with the tsars and emperors of various dynasties, and we do not intend to break this connection. Instead, we are going to show the common people that the emperor cares for each of them.\n\nTo this end, Belozersky will embark on a tour of the largest cities in the newly acquired territories. During his trip, the Tsar will demonstrate to the new citizens that they are not in any way second-class or superfluous."
 MAR_allrussian_congress_desc:0 "Finally, our party rules over the lands from Arkhangelsk to Kamchatka; we remain the only legitimate government on the territory of Russia. After so much time and effort, the time has come to hold the first truly all-Russian Congress of Soviets. At it, we will discuss options for the further development of our state, as well as our place on the world stage."

 MAR_epilogue.4.d:0 "Alexei Anatolyevich was a man of firm convictions. In his youth, he belonged to a radical socialist circle and even participated in an environmental protest during Bukharin's era. Of course, this idealism gradually faded. First the war with Germany, then the crushing defeat. As a soldier under General Rokossovsky, he retreated beyond the Urals only to face Kaganovich's dictatorship. While his idealism dimmed, he refused to submit to tyranny. With help from good souls, he managed to reach the Siberian Republic.\n\nHere Alexei first tasted true freedom - local elections, free speech, press liberty. A breath of fresh air for a simple Soviet citizen. This didn't last. During the West Russian War, Yagoda stabbed them in the back, leaving the republic confined to Tomsk. It was then Alexei joined the Salon of Humanists.\n\nBut that was the past. Power shifted again, and now the former deputy held a Mladorossi party ticket. Could young revolutionary Lyoshka have imagined serving a Russian Tsar? Unlikely. We never know the future. Alexei's no fool - he knows party branches exist solely to unanimously support the Tsar's decisions. Yet who knows? Perhaps the uncompromising workers' rights advocate might still make his mark."

His father, a White emigrant and proud Cossack, never accepted defeat. Hearing of Far Eastern uprising plans, he moved the family to Harbin. Reality proved harsher - the movement collapsed from infighting, Russia descending into anarchy. Vasily's father later perished clashing with Rodzaevsky's troops. After this, the young officer couldn't abandon his father's dream.\n\nYears passed, circumstances changed, silver threads appearing in the soldier's hair. Ultimately, his forces were defeated.\n\nNow the White Russia dream lay shattered again, Vasily among the defeated. Russia was unified, but what unity? Red-White ideology, reconciling with the past. Was this worth his father's death? Yet they weren't Reds either, still led by a Tsar...\n\nVasily sensed war approaching. If Russia lost now, there might be no second chance. Perhaps a compromise with conscience - choosing between devil and confused homeland, he'd always side with Motherland. Gazing at his father's saber, he smiled. Soon it might see action."

For a long time now, Belozersky had been traveling across the country on his working tour. After conducting inspections in major cities of European Russia, he headed beyond the Urals.\n\n- Comrade Belozersky. - A voice interrupted his thoughts.\n\nTurning towards the source, Belozersky saw his assistant.\n\n- I'm listening. - Belozersky responded.\n\n- The pilots report we'll be landing at Yekaterinburg Airport shortly. - The assistant informed.\n\n- Very well. You're dismissed. - Belozersky replied, turning back to the window.\n\nAccording to reports sent to the imperial capital, the capital of Western Siberia should have recovered from devastation - something Belozersky intended to verify. After a smooth landing, Air Force One stopped and the boarding ramp attached.\n\nAll eyes on the tarmac were fixed on the opened aircraft door: regional leadership, honor guards, and media. Moments later, Belozersky emerged. Pausing at the top of the ramp, he surveyed the airport while cameras captured the moment.\n\n- The airport looks like it was built yesterday. - Belozersky thought to himself.\n\nDescending, he was greeted by officials and proceeded to the motorcade. For thirty minutes, Belozersky listened to reports while observing the pristine new highway and numerous construction sites. Entering the city, the convoy was met by crowds waving imperial flags and cheering loudly enough to be heard through closed windows.\n\nThe suburbs shone with restored buildings, infrastructure, shops, and businesses. Approaching downtown, more skyscrapers rose where ruins once stood. Passing the administration building, Belozersky admired the grand square before the motorcade exited to the suburbs, eventually reaching an industrial zone and new factory."

While disputes raged for hours, truthfully this session served more as a diplomatic signal to the world - demonstrating Russia's readiness to reclaim territories by force.\n\nThe media fallout was immediate. German outlets called it provocation, while Western sociologists speculated about potential war. One fact became clear: both the world and Russia are changing, this congress being the final catalyst. All now understand conflict is unavoidable."

The Tsar never secretly decreed its formation, nor did Vladimir Vladimirovich Gill personally select each operative. The 'Cerberus Squad' never abducted officials suspected of terrorist ties. The 'Cerberus Squad' never buried dozens of terrorism suspects in taiga forests. The 'Cerberus Squad' never executed militants after storming their last major camp.

A day dividing Kosygin's life into "before" and "after". He understood this and prepared meticulously: crafting speeches, considering his appearance before the people and foreign dignitaries. Now the moment had arrived.\n\nAlexei Romanov emerged onto the nation's central square under heavy guard. Security was overwhelming, with snipers positioned on rooftops. Gill had insisted, and the Tsar himself didn't object, remembering that ill-fated congress. Approaching the coronation dais, the new monarch solemnly received imperial regalia. A crimson mantle, exquisitely crafted for this occasion, draped his shoulders, while the imperial crown forged for Catherine II's coronation rested upon his head. As the archbishop concluded the rites, the Tsar began his address:\n\n\"Hail, my people! Together under my guidance, we've traversed fire and water, endless nights and fleeting days! Now, through your efforts, Russia stands united after thirty long years! I swear fealty to you, my people, and to Russia herself! I pledge that under my reign, she shall thrive undivided by enemies or calamities! To honor this Great Day in our lives and our nation's history, I declare the next three days a holiday! Rejoice and celebrate! Russia has irrevocably entered a new epoch!\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in rapturous cheers and applause, bidding farewell to their Emperor with ecstasy.\n\nLater in his chambers, the newly crowned ruler reflected:\n\n\"I... I've finally become Russia's rightful Tsar... I led them through a decade of darkness and despair to this new dawn... I must not fail them. The people's faith is evident. I must complete Russia's rebirth. For I... Alexei II Kosygin-Romanov, Tsar of All Russia, am uniquely destined for this task.\"\n\nHaving fully embraced his role, he turned his thoughts to the future."

Prove your worth!\" screamed the drill instructor.\n\nFor Zaitsev, veteran of unification wars from the Second Time of Troubles to Magadan, the regime remained brutal. Two-hour dawn drills preceded endless running, marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, meager rations, then more training. Men broke bones - some died - yet none faltered. Like Zaitsev, all burned with desire to serve Emperor and Motherland. His reverie shattered as the general barked:\n\n\"Well done, maggots! Gear up for live combat simulation! You've fought traitors, but our true enemy will be fiercer! Prepare!\"\n\nThe elite troops immediately regrouped, following their commander to a mock battlefield replicating war with the German Reich. Objectives: destroy five tanks, clear live-fire obstacles, then command simulated battles against fellow elites acting as OpFor. Zaitsev knew the challenge but remained undaunted.\n\nAt the signal, soldiers stormed forward. Some hurled anti-tank grenades awkwardly. Zaitsev infiltrated a tank with feline grace, eliminating its \"crew\". During obstacle clearance, a recruit fell from height, breaking his leg amid simulated gunfire. The survivors pressed on.\n\nThe climax came with tactical command simulation. Zaitsev assumed leadership, improvising strategies shouted to his \"subordinates\". \"Execute orders, soldiers!\" barked the makeshift colonel. Diversionary maneuvers fooled the OpFor - fake grenade throws preceded encirclement tactics. Zaitsev's unit secured the high ground. Victory.\n\nThe general offered rare praise before resuming drills. After final exercises came meager rations, then blessed oblivion."

After adjusting it slightly, he smiled and left home. 'How long has it been since I wore this,' Andrei thought.\n\nWalking down the street, he noticed many were discontent with recent events. Some complained about the noise from ships outside their windows. Others recalled Matkovsky's era with horror, fearing a repeat of RFP's atrocities through this port's revival. But some, like Andrei himself, welcomed it warmly – seeing opportunities for prestigious naval posts, maritime business ventures, or Magadan's development. Many nostalgic souls reminisced about shipping's golden age, proud their city had regained this honor; several were old USSR Navy veterans.\n\nStopping at a new portside shop along the way, Andrei bought bottled water and greeted an old friend. Continuing onward, he observed countless new stores capitalizing on Magadan and Kamchatka becoming hubs of Russia's Navy.\n\nApproaching his destination, he passed the city's new landmark – a statue honoring heroes of Russia's Pacific Fleet who perished defending the Motherland from Japanese threats.\n\nFinally arriving at the ship crew recruitment office, Andrei began: 'Hello, I...'"

Surprisingly cordial, the minister insisted on touring California's coastline together, determined to showcase America's natural and cultural splendor to the Russian monarch. Thus began Emperor Alexei II's Californian odyssey.\n\nTheir journey commenced at the Golden Gate Bridge. While the Tsar attempted serious discourse, Rogers persistently lightened the mood, gradually fostering genuine camaraderie between them.\n\nThe tour spanned San Francisco to Los Angeles, culminating in Hollywood where Alexei observed filming of 'American Graffiti' and conversed with director George Lucas.\n\nThe finale unfolded at Russia's San Francisco Consulate. Here, having built rapport during their travels, both leaders discussed substantive matters in amicable tones. Topics included deepened cooperation, mutual investments, and crucially – U.S. assistance in reclaiming Rus' territories. Tensions flared as Rogers hesitated to further strain relations with Germany and Japan. Yet ultimately, the Tsar prevailed. Agreements were signed: America guaranteed support for Russia's territorial claims, recognized its legal rights, reduced mutual tariffs, and expanded trade."

Yes, it possessed many technological marvels and was itself a world pioneer in technology. But it was precisely this country that had become one of the reasons for his Homeland's fall. This very nation had oppressed his subjects, his people. No! He must banish these thoughts. Pragmatism matters more now than any ideologies. The purpose of this visit is to strengthen relations, trade, and discuss Priamurye's return.\n\nThe visit began with a meeting between the Tsar and the Japanese Empire's Foreign Minister. Surprisingly, he received him warmly. They then entered a car and proceeded to the meeting place - the Russian Embassy in Japan, located at the heart of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in Tokyo. Along the way, the Tsar admired the views from the window, though he carefully hid any outward signs of awe to avoid appearing weak before a Superpower. He marveled at the Japanese capital's beauty and wondered - could Russia ever become like this? Could he build a nation surpassing even this currently declining power?\n\nFinally arriving at the meeting venue, negotiations commenced. Initially everything went smoothly: trade agreements and partnership accords were signed. But when the Tsar broached the Priamurye issue, tensions quickly rose... Ultimately, he only secured the Minister's promise to relay negotiation proposals about Priamurye to the Emperor. The meeting concluded on this note."
