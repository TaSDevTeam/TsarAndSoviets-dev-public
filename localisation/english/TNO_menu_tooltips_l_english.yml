TNO_ODF_icon_tt: "§CPuella Magi §GMaria§! Magica§!"
TNO_ODF_icon_tt_delayed: "§F§CPuella Magi Madoka Magica§! - a mahō shōjo anime released in 2011. Produced by §BSHAFT§! with an original script by §RGen Urobuchi§!, its initial episodes appeared relatively typical for the genre. However, the anime later reveals itself from a §Rcompletely different angle§!. Instead of a typical tale of §Ygoodies vs baddies§!, it presents a profound story about §Chope§! and §qdespair§!.\n\nYour humble servant, head of the code department at §wTsar and Soviets§! and the team's sole active coder, §Qdzugendoff§!, encountered this work in late 2024. After an initial viewing, he dismissed it. Yet upon deeper immersion into its context, he gave it a second chance – transforming PMMM into a beloved work (info as of March 2025).\n\nWhat prompted this update? Truthfully, attempts to create an April Fools' update existed since 2023. Most were axed early to avoid diverting efforts to questionable projects. The degradation of §oThe New Order§!'s development became the final straw for §wsubmod§! fatigue. Following the release of §oClash§! of §KCivilizations§!, the decision was made to pursue what might be this submod's final update.\n\nAnd since I'm the coder here, the update's theme became a crossover (or rather fanfiction) of my favorite anime. Well then, §Yshall we dive headfirst into the update?§!§!"
