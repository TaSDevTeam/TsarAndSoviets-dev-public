TNO_ODF_icon_tt_delayed: "§FTwo different §Ycivilizations§!, two different §Mworlds§!, different §Cfates§!...\n\nLet us look at Central Europe, where we encounter a giant - §othe Greater German Reich§!. Master of Europe, one of the three leading §Gsuperpowers§!, spreading its influence from Windhoek in the south to Svalbard in the north, from Dublin in the west to Tehran in the east. A developed industry, particularly automotive, mechanical engineering, chemical, and electrical industries, a thriving economy. The average resident of §othe Reich§!, at the very least, does not have an urgent need to search for sustenance or shelter from possible bombings.\n\nMoving beyond the Volga, before our eyes lies §nRussia§!... or rather, §Rwhat remains of it§!. Vast territories, washed by oceans and seas, divided among a couple of dozen §Vwarlords§!, each considering themselves the sole rightful rulers of this land. Russia, rich in resources: oil, gas, timber, water, with an equally rich history and culture, is now in an utterly pitiable and wretched state.\n\nHow did it come to this? Just §p50 years§! ago, two empires - §nthe Russian§! and §jthe German§! - were on equal footing, with their own ambitions and goals. How drastically has the fate of these two powers changed? In such a short historical period, the bear and the eagle clashed in mortal combat three times - in §RWorld War I§!, §RWorld War II§!, and the §RWest Russian War§!. Unfortunately for §nRussia§!, each time ended in §edefeat§!.\n\nNow §nRussia§! is engulfed in §fthe Second Time of Troubles§! - anarchy. But nothing lasts forever, and §nRussia§! is destined to §Gunite§! and clash with §oGermany§! once more. However, this time, for both powers, this will become §Rthe final attempt§! to permanently assert their §Ysupremacy§!. With an arsenal capable of §ldestroying the entire world§!, this becomes a fight to the death.\n\n§xThe Final Battle§! is near, and the victor is undetermined.§!"
