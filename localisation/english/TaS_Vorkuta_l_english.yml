 POLITICS_VASILY_BLOKHI_DESC: "Some men have strict moral codes. Vasily Mikhailovich Blokhin abandoned them long ago, when he became the chief executioner of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, the NKVD. His effectiveness in "wetwork" as a Cheka member would not go unnoticed, and so he would quickly gain a higher position. Blokhin's brutality was unmatched: he personally oversaw mass executions of "enemies of the state", from the most insignificant ones to those of the most prominent Bolsheviks in the history of the Soviet Union. Thousands would perish under his watch, yet he himself would manage to avoid being affected by any purges carried out.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War and the humiliating defeat of the USSR, Blokhin would not let his power go that easily. As chief of the Vorkutlag, a large gulag complex, he would exercise his power, initially as the face of the West Russian Revolutionary Front's authority. In reality, he did whatever he wanted to, and there was no one that could stop him, for they would be executed or mysteriously disappear. However, things would change with the rebellion of the gulag inmates against the guards: the formation of the dissident group of the Ural League put him in danger, but soon he would reign supreme once again as they fled southwards.\n\nVasily Blokhin was left to govern the gulags of Vorkuta, and now the city itself, on his own, especially as the WRRF crumbled with the famous West Russian War. With the help of what few guards remained, he would reorganize the area, and effectively set up his warlord state. However, Blokhin is not an ambitious man; all he wants is for his fiefdom to be left alone and survive, no matter what the cost for that may be."

It was with him both in the bright hours of the collapse of the autocracy and the convening of the Constituent Assembly, and in the dark moments of its dispersal with the rise to power of the Bolsheviks, traitors to the cause of socialism. \n\nDreams of Russia by and for the people burned brightly in him even when the bloodsuckers of the NKVD came after him, intending to leave him to rot forever in the frozen barracks of the Vorkutlag. No way. \n\nThe Bolshevik Union had fallen, unable to withstand the legions of Nazis. The Vorkutlag, no longer fed by the endless stream of prisoners of conscience, had also fallen. The torturers of true socialists on Russian soil have fallen. \n\nHenceforth, over the frozen wasteland flew the Red Banners with the slogans of the Left Socialist Social Revolutionaries resurrected from oblivion. Boris Kamkov, now leading the vanguard of the new Russian revolution in the weary Russian land, has also risen from oblivion. The dream of the people's kingdom of freedom and labor shines brighter than ever, and Kamkov is confident that it will henceforth, never shrink to a faint candle in his ever-burning heart."

The need for the Vorkutgulag did not vanish with his former overlords. Therefore Blokhin continues the job given to him by Bukharin.\n\nDespite there not being many Gulags, they still produce essential products. However, the fall of the USSR led to the general decline of Russia, which also affected Vorkuta. Life in these places is hard, but only for prisoners, who make up the vast majority of the population. The other half of the population are camp guards who make sure that no one escapes or completes, and they clearly live better than others.\n\nThe next camp reporting period is coming. They collect all the data and information about the income and expenses of this whole small state. What can change here?"

 vorkuta_start.1.t:0 "Camp Report"
 vorkuta_start.1.d:0 "Vasily Blokhin was drinking coffee and eating a breakfast while reading the report on the effectiveness of the camps. Initially, he did not even want to look at what was included in this report, because usually everything is always written the same way: how many died; how many forests and other useful resources were extracted; how many food supplies were left; income, expenses and a detailed list of camps with how many people were there.\n\n Usually, it all looked extremely monotonous. After the fall of Bukharin's USSR, things got much worse, but Kaganovich, while he was the head of the West Siberian Soviet Republic, was happy to use Vorkuta as a camp center, and therefore, even in these difficult days, he managed to catch a lot of criminals and dissidents. But after the collapse of the Kaganovich Republic, Blokhin remained, in fact, alone in Vorkuta, left to himself. Hundreds died from difficult conditions, dozens from executions. Somehow, Vorkuta lives, but Blokhin's power can be undermined by his camp guards, who are frankly not happy with the fact that Vasily did not do anything useful, and the prisoners, because everything goes not to provide citizens and prisoners, but to ensure the top authorities.Turning to the report, he began to pay attention to the fact that the number of victims and disobedience has increased. The bombing of the Nazis has recently been particularly painful for the camps, which from a height are very convenient targets. Free Aviators cannot always save Western Siberia, because this time the bombing is especially painful. And besides, over the past year, the supply of the camps themselves has deteriorated significantly, which is why cases of deaths from starvation have become more frequent, and those who survived are beginning to show obvious disobedience. Disobedience is especially scary, because it can lead to the collapse of the whole shaky "economy", if it can be said so, which is based on pumping out the last forces of prisoners and giving all property in favor of the NKVD.\n\n It seems that in order to stay in power it is necessary to do something. Blokhin was not happy about this, but he told his adjutant to start preparing papers for the publication of any decrees. Again."

Instead of being welcomed as heroes, we were jailed and labeled counter-revolutionaries. We were torn away from all we hold dear, and sent to the ends of the earth. To here, to this hellscape. Here we languished without hope for justice or salvation. We worked for Blokhin until our flesh began to peel from our bones. We watched our friends, diseased, bruised, and broken, drop dead in front of our very eyes. But they could not break us! Today, they will receive a message. They can no longer live at the expensive of our humanity. We, will no longer allow them to live at the expensive of our humanity. Today comrades, Vorkuta will become a place of liberty and refuge for the people of Russia.""

When he heard the prisoners can captured some military equipment he started to sweat. He knew that his time was slowly running out. He told his aid to initiate Plan B, and a few hours later a special contingent of the NKVD started to approach the camp. The cars hurriedly crossed the white expanse, as the distant camp became larger and larger. The soldiers finally arrived at their desinitation and began to take their positions. Machine gun bullets riddled the trucks. Somehow, the prisoners had acquired machine guns. The trucks, panicked, started to flee. The soldiers who were already out of their cars were left for dead. \n\nKamkov, the leader of the revolution, bent over a map he found in the camp manager’s office. He said, "So, there’s the city we need to take, and what’s o the south...?"  He squinted trying to make out the handwriting. The map was made in the 20s and was almost completely inaccurate. He paused, then continued "Well I think that’s Yugra. They say that some bandits and thieves live there... Hopefully they don’t become a problem in the future" A nearby prisoner injerjected.

The prisoners were somehow armed. Everyone, everyone was useless! n\n Blokhin murmured "They won’t have the dignity of kill-” The door to his office swang open, and Blokhin, who was standing on a chair, lost balance and fell to the ground. Armed prisoners had entered his office. Leading them was Kamkov. Blokhin reached for his pistol but Kamkov stomped on his hand. Blokhin’s face transformed from a grin to one of abject horror. Kamkov looked down at him and said “Comrade Blokhin, you are accused of counter-revolutionary activities, and therefore you are sentenced to summary exucation. Please come with us.” Blokhin kicked and screamed “no. NO!” while he was forcibly dragged by two prisoners."

In the Workers’ and peasants’ Republic of the Urals, the people should own the fruits of their labor."\n\nThe people of Vorkuta, his comrades, had not received the speech as positively as he had hoped. The people in the front of the crowd, who Kamkov had chosen due to their loyalty to him, began to chant in approval, but behind them a collective gasp could be heard.\n\nSomeone from the crowd yelled “Listen, hun, you certainly speak about such beautiful things, but think about it! Where are the peasants? There are five Republic of the Urals? We don’t need no revolution, we need to survive.” The crowd started to yell “Victors of what revolution?” louder and louder.\n\n Another person suddenly appeared on the stage and said \n"It is our job to liberate the peasants and laborers of Russia. It would be a betrayal of the motherland to not spread the revolution." Kamkov's saw something within the man, something familar.\n- Kamkov turned to the man and asked “Are you Volodya?” \n- The man responded with a chuckle “I haven’t been called that in a long time”\n- Kamkov smiled and said  “It’s been so long"

 vorkuta_start.22.d:0 "Ugra and all those who now live in the "people's kingdom" of the Left Social Revolutionaries. The long-awaited hour of reckoning has come for the former masters of the city - the bandits, under whose formidable right hand the surrounding land and the people inhabiting it had languished and suffocated in blood for almost a decade. \n\n Throughout the city and the adjacent neighborhoods, soldiers with red ribbons, bows, and armbands on their uniforms, led out under the snow of this harsh land crowds of various criminals, ranging from rapists to embezzlers of national wealth, in dirty stitched clothes, who were yesterday Gods in a world where it seemed that the word of God and light had never been seen. In the broken streets, among the ruins and remnants of ruined buildings, lonely lampposts and telegraph poles stood like charred bald trees on the ashes after a fire, where not so long ago stood centuries-old oak trees. The masses of brigands, frozen, tired, and having hardly eaten for the last two days, were walking with their last strength, losing one or two of their companions every few minutes, who fell to the frozen ground without strength, leaving a dead trail behind them. Their groups, small as they were, were thinning out in front of their eyes. And now, after about half an hour from the beginning of this mass walk, the purpose of which was called by a vague "order from their superiors," the convoyers gave a brief glance and began to carry out that very order. Rifle butts, pistol grips, homemade clubs without spikes, sticks and simple fists sharply fell on the final ones. The uncomprehending hordes of convicts tried to fight back, but could barely find the strength to stand on their feet, so one by one they fell to the ground, showered with blows from their jailers. Half of them were beaten to death, and not a single shot was fired - the order not to waste ammunition was duly obeyed. \n\n However, the survivors were much less fortunate. The wounded, barely alive people were lifted to their feet, all their clothes were torn off by force, and when they were completely naked, they began the monstrous massacres. A bayonet in the chest or a knife stuck in the stomach and then drawn through it was the best way to end, and therefore the rarest. Hanging upside down on a rope, completely naked in such weather, was worse. Chopping off stiff limbs, from fingers to nose and ears, along with gouging out eyes, breaking bones, and eventually disfiguring bodies were as common in those minutes as rifle fire. All over the city naked bandits were tied with ropes and wire to poles, on which they could hang a couple of other men at the same time. But not all of them were stripped at once. Some were even brought into warm rooms and, after tea, offered to escape if they killed one or more of their fellow prisoners. Without hesitation, these terrible battles of the weak against the weak began again in the streets, where there were usually no winners. And if there were any, they were bound together with the corpses of their slain brothers and thrown to perish together under the gray sky of the North. No one escaped the hand of revolutionary justice that day. The corpses of those hanged were not removed, but others were nailed to makeshift crosses, skinned, some beheaded, and placed throughout the city for many days as a symbol of popular justice."

 vorkuta_start.23.d:0 "In one old, semi-basement room of Yugra, surrounded by the quiet crackling of the "burzhuika", two men were discussing the latest news, both from their lives and from the life of the city. Rather not discussing, but thinking about what and how to do next. A young man in his twenties and an old man who had passed the half-century mark were stuffing newspaper scraps with mahorka that had just been dried on the stove, and after lighting a match they filled their shelter again and again with thick, acrid smoke. A few cans of tinned food, a couple of loaves of homemade local bread and some pickled vegetables, for which the old man had traded from Zlatoustinsk traders before the New Year for a couple of well-preserved bottles of vodka produced before the war. Modest, but it should be enough. The kettle rumbled and the gray-haired master, after a few routine operations, presented his companion with a mug of hot berry tea and spoke again:\n\n I'm a big figure now, the chairman of the "People's Court" after all, but you understand, Vanya, with what you've done, you'll be sent to the mines for a quarter, or even worse. \n\n Well, Afanasy Matveyevich. - Having made a few scalding slugs of surprisingly delicious tea, he continued: "Well, yes, I raped a woman, but is that a bad thing? I'm ready to redeem myself in the ranks of Comrade Kamkov's People's Army! I'd like to go into battle tomorrow! \nIt's one thing for Vanya to rape her and get it over with. But it's quite another when you all your gang gathered together, robbed the men who were coming from Zlatoust, found out when her parents wouldn't be in the house and went to her hut, first drugged her, and then started raping her together! But it wasn't enough for you! So you started raping her sisters and brothers too!? And when the parents came to the house, you stabbed the father with knives and fucked the mother right in front of her children! And when you'd had enough, you took everything of value out of the house and burned it! I would have been nailed to boards, skinned and left like all your friends until spring! I'd twist your head off myself if I didn't owe your dead father my life. :\n\n The old man stopped talking and calmed down a little. The fire was crackling more and more faintly, and the cold was beginning to creep into the already far from warm room. Vanya looked at Afanasy Matveyevich with a serious and despairing look, having emptied his mug. \nWith saccharine? - He suddenly cut the silence abruptly. \nNot exactly, Vanya.\nSeconds of incomprehension were abruptly replaced by a wild thumping in his temples. A moment later his legs gave out and he collapsed from the stool onto the concrete. Afanasy Matveetsch only stood up calmly and poured water from a kettle into the fireplace, plunging the room into darkness. The cold began to serve itself at once much faster. He took Ivanov's fanny pack from the nightstand, twirled it for himself and, lighting a cigarette, said monotonously :\nFor all crimes committed by you and your accomplices, you are sentenced to capital punishment. The sentence is final and cannot be appealed.  \nHe stopped talking and said quietly, with fatherly love:\nBut Masha loved you.... She wanted to marry you. She hid it from everyone, but only revealed it to me. And you.\nI swear by God, I will fight to the last drop of blood, so that there will be no more of you, the spawn, from now until the end of centuries in the land of Russia. \n\n The sound of the lock was the last thing Ivan heard in his life."

What's a Frenchman doing here anyway? \n\n The young officer, if such a notion is at all applicable to the commanders of the SR militia, was in a state of deep shock. He had seen a lot in his life, but he had never imagined that he would find a man with the surname of Richelieu in the Russian north. In addition, with his first name and patronymic...\n- Calm down, monsieur, I'll explain everything to you. - began the strange guest standing before his desk. Despite his age (he was about seventy) he seemed to be a stately and elegant man. He had a beautiful mustache, as if from a newspaper photograph from forty years ago, and medium-length black hair like tar. The owner made no secret of the fact that he used dye, but where he got it was a mystery. His tall stature, his manner of speaking, and a cigarette in his teeth clearly distinguished him as a native of glorious Odessa. A white suit with the same shirt, shoes polished with goutaline, neat gray pants, and a gray-brownish-crimson scarf around his neck, which, no matter how the owner did not twist it, could not always hide the scars from knife strokes - the echo of the former turbulent youth. At last, leaning on his expensive cane and smoking half a cigarette, he began :\n- Suleiman Ostapovich Richelieu, son of a French gentleman. Until recently he was the manager of Petrovskaya 27. He came to serve the revolution and help the workers of all countries to fight against the exploitation of the world capitalists. \nThe officer's eyes rolled back and he found himself in more shock, which surprisingly quickly wore off. \n- What was your job before the war? \n- Many places. He participated in the construction of the Great Eastern Mainline, was involved in the development of skiing in Karelia, instilled in the villages of the Volga region a love of chess, was a fire inspector, an aeronaut and many others. \n- How long have you been in Ugra? \n- Passing through, for the past eight months. Two and a half years ago I traveled from Tomsk to Zlatoust on behalf of the now deceased President Pasternak. But! A tragic series of accidents and coincidences forced me to stop there. \n- And what have you been doing? \n- He traded like everyone else. Business was going well, but an American young man who came from the East so charmed one of Kalashnikov's daughters that she decided to run away with him to the New World. I could not resist the pure desire of Amur's victims and helped them leave the city. That's how I ended up here.\n- I wonder what happened to them? And why didn't the bandits touch you? \n- Let's say they helped us escape, and while Kalashnikov's men were chasing us, they managed to grab a thousand or two rifles. And everybody's happy. \n- Except for my people... \n- They drank most of it in a month and spent the rest in raids on Rokossovsky or sold it to locals. Therefore. \n- Despite all this and good words from the residents, I can't appoint you to the position of supply commander. You're not even a Party member! When you get your ticket, we'll talk. \n- Wrong. \nSuleiman Ostapovich threw the cigarette butt into a bucket near the corner, smiled and took an old, yellowed sheet of paper out of his pocket and laid it on the table. The pre-revolutionary font, the menacing ink strokes and the words : \n"Issued on the 2nd, XII, 1917.\nIssued - B. Kamkov."\n\n After a few heavy breaths, he dipped his pen into the ink and began to write something on one of his forms. A couple of minutes later, he signed and sealed it loudly, then handed both documents to Richelieu. \n- Tomorrow at 6:00. Dismissed. \nThe "veteran" immediately left the office and was gone."

However, we overestimated our enemies. The bandits, although they had a few workshops serving their fighting units, were for the most part completely supplied from Zlatoust. Almost all the large enterprises remained in a mothballed state, occasionally subjected to air raids or raids by other military commanders. In this regard, Andrei Kolegaev decided to form repair brigades that would bring the abandoned industry to a working state.\n\nAndrei from morning to night was in his office. It was necessary to solve a lot of organizational issues and find workers to open new enterprises. He was distracted from these matters by the arrival of one of the foremen.\n\n- Hello, I have a report on our work, - said the foreman.\n- Hello, put the report here, then I'll read it. Summarize briefly, how are things going? - Andrei replied. Let's just say that the situation is better than we expected. Of the local enterprises, there is only a wood processing plant and one inoperative thermal power plant in the suburbs of Yugorsk. Our workers are now repairing them and preparing them for operation. We will be able to start them up in the near future. There are a few more enterprises, but their repair will take much longer," the foreman said.\n "It wasn't enough," Kolegaev thought. "Better than nothing, but it won't change the situation in our favor."\nThe worker hurriedly continued: "But in addition to that, we also found a warehouse where some of the weapons machines from Leningrad had been evacuated.

"It's a shame that so few people came," he thought. Pyotr learned about the opening of enrollment in the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party from a friend of his. They were both going to apply to join, but later the friend abandoned this idea, because "Soon Kaganovich will come here and send the SRs to Vorkutlag again. I will not sign my own death warrant." Peter had just laughed at these words then and decided that he would not give up his plans because of foolish predictions, but now, when he saw the half-empty hall, it seemed to him that he had made some mistake. A mistake that could have fatal consequences years from now. "Maybe it really isn't worth it? Where will this road take me? Where will I be a year from now? Will I be alive?" - all these thoughts ran through Peter's mind as he waited for the meeting to begin.He himself did not notice how the hall filled up. There were still some empty rows, but most of the hall was already filled with people. \n\n He was distracted from his thoughts by an elderly man with glasses who came on stage and addressed the audience. He had no microphone, but his voice sounded clear and distinct, reaching everyone in the audience. "May I have your attention please!" - he said, and all conversation instantly fell silent. "I am glad to welcome you to the first meeting of the new members of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party. My name is Karelin Vladimir Alexandrovich. Today young SRs, we will discuss many important things. I will tell you about the history of our party, about the past, and, much more importantly, about the future. We'll also discuss the ideas of Narodnikism and social revolution, but first... Each of you will tell me why you decided to join the party. Briefly, just a few words, otherwise we won't get anywhere here. Please, each in turn." Each in turn stood up and gave his reasons why he had left an application to join the party. Some wanted to make the Motherland better, some believed in the world Revolution, and some even had relatives or friends who had been in the Party before it was disbanded in 1923. \n\n When the turn came to Peter, he answered quite frankly: "I joined the party because I felt it was my cause." Expecting that he would probably be chased away, he laughed at his own audacity and naivete. Karelin only replied, "It has its place." The meeting continued for several hours, and eventually Peter became convinced that his choice to join the Left SRs was the right one."

Some of them were diligently studying details on maps of the area, while on a nearby table, radio operators were working on tuning radios, preparing communications for the upcoming operation. Among the officers present was Lee Harvey Oswald, who was studying the list of scout team members who were due to arrive any minute. Most of them were simply distinguished soldiers, some had even been in Vorkutlag before Kamkov's coup. Oswald noted that the list also included several veterans of SMERSH, the former Soviet counterintelligence service.\n\n-is this everyone we were given? - Oswald asked. Yes, Comrade Oswald. It's modest, but in our situation, it's a miracle we have anyone other than green recruits. Yes, it could have been a lot worse," he agreed. After a while, the sounds of trucks approaching could be heard in the distance. Oswald and a few other officers went outside to meet them. Several trucks stopped next to the tent. The soldiers were unloading and lining up in front of the tent. In all, about forty soldiers arrived and formed into two lines.\nWhile the squad leaders reported to the officers about their arrival, Oswald addressed the soldiers.\n "Gentlemen, do you realize that you will be the first to participate in foreign intelligence for your country? The Council and Kamkov's first impression of First Control depends on your success. Right now they are treating all of this..." - Oswald looked back at the staff tent. "...As just another experiment. But if we exceed their expectations, if we show what a formidable force we are, then in the future the First Directorate and the Commissariat itself may become something much more than just an intelligence bureau. And then, gentlemen, we will go down in history."\nThe soldiers looked at each other. None of them had expected to hear that. "Well, let's get to work!" - exclaimed one of the officers. The squads began to prepare for their first mission."

While the people of Yugorsk and the other liberated settlements celebrate the collapse of bandit tyranny, more and more news comes to us from beyond the Urals. Germany is choking on its ambitions and has fallen into civil war, and the oppressed masses all over Europe are rising up and trying to break free from the slavery into which they were driven by the fascist despots. Now we would like to carry the banner of revolution all over Europe together, but it looks like we will have to fight our battle in the Urals first. Our enemies from the south are preparing to cut each other's throats, and when they do, it will be our turn. We cannot wait any longer, the plan of action is ready, all that is left is to execute it. \nOur militia trains daily in the extreme conditions of the far north and turns into a force comparable to a real army.Our hard-working workers, tirelessly and without sparing effort, restore towns and villages destroyed by German bombs and bandit raids.The hearts of people all over the Urals demand revolution and they will get it. The first step will be Chairman Kamkov's address to the people of our Republic."

Separately, the Zlatoust Arms Factory, whose weapons can be found all over Russia and which has become for us the embodiment of the horrors of capitalism and the unrestrained human thirst for profit, should be singled out. Enterprises in Vorkuta are operating almost at full capacity. What cannot be said about the new territories of Ugra. There are only a few plants here, many of the shops were damaged by German air raids, and some of the equipment was sold to the Zlatoust givers in exchange for weapons and food.\n It's important to note that we have a stratum of people who are currently unemployed. Basically, they are ordinary people from the once bandit Yugra who haven't yet adapted to the new life. We'll give them jobs, because it's unacceptable for someone to be idle in a working state. We just found abandoned factories in the suburbs of Yugorsk and Salekhard. No matter how run-down they may be, we will clean them up and make decent places for our citizens to work out of this junk."

Today a Ministry of Agitation and Propaganda will be established to correct this misunderstanding. Motivational posters and propaganda leaflets will decorate every house and factory, becoming the embodiment of our ideas. Radio broadcasting will carry propaganda throughout the country, even to the most remote corners like Salekhard or the Ural Mountains. Every mouthpiece on the border will criticize our opponents and broadcast anthems.\n\nWe are putting all our efforts into ensuring that this great reform affects not only us, our loyal citizens, but also those who still doubt the rightness of our path."

Our trump card is the revolution, and our allies are the workers and peasants of the entire Urals! While their armies face us on the front, our agents ignite a spark of rebellion in the heart of their rear. Neither Kaganovich, nor Rokossovsky, nor all the other dictators of the Urals, have ever considered the common people and this mistake will be fatal for them. Our agents already know the factories and collective farms with the most inhumane working conditions, and it is there that the fuse of the revolution will be lit, which will undermine the domination of the dictators throughout the Urals."

In addition to standard measures to restore order, the President has ordered a package of decrees to protect the rights of vulnerable and oppressed sectors of society. There is no place in our state for oppression and discrimination, especially when our enemies on the contrary breed malice among their own people.

The recruits, exhausted from their merciless training in the young fighter course, gathered around the fireplace, near which the commander was tuning the radio.Tired from training, the soldiers were annoyed that the officer had ordered them to gather at their own time, which made them whisper unhappily. Some tune was quietly playing on the radio, but after that it was replaced by someone else's voice. Quiet! It's about to start... - the officer turned up the volume, and everyone realized that it was the leader of the Republic, Boris Kamkov, who was broadcasting.\n Comrades! Brothers and sisters! Now our dear Republic is already standing confidently on its feet! We are taking our first steps in liberating the workers and peasants of the entire Urals, and our victory over the Yugra bandits is a direct indicator that we are on the right track! And we will go further, and I swear that we will not stop until we throw off the shackles of the exploiters and parasites from all the common people in the Urals! The fascists have stopped bombing not only our cities, but also the fiefdoms of our enemies. Their factories and plants once again drive the workers to slaughter and the peasants to slave labor! Their soldiers train day and night to break our vanguards! They think it is enough to break our spirit and will to be free! They have never been so wrong... All their efforts are but drops in the sea of our unyielding determination. We will resist them as the Ural Mountains resist the north wind...\n "Suddenly the transmission broke, and there was an awkward silence among the soldiers. At that moment someone shouted loudly, "For the Republic!" and the others didn't hesitate to pick up on his cry, "For Kamkov!" "For the revolution!"

Most of them were slovenly alcoholics and simply unemployed, but there were also a few children among them. Times were extremely hard, and such a situation was no longer astonishing. However, one could not help but notice the two invalids sitting at the end of the bus. One was missing an eye and an ear, and the other was sitting with a crutch and without a leg. Apparently, both were veterans, and with such injuries surviving in Yugra was a real feat. "We'll find somewhere to put them," thought Kostya.\n \n Finally, the bus pulled into the factory and the workers began to head for the shop. The old shift was already gathering outside, getting ready to go home. This plant had been abandoned for a while, but just a couple of weeks ago, maintenance crews had brought it back on line. Upon entering the shop, a huge hole in the ceiling, covered with a cloak cloth, was immediately striking. There is probably not a plant in the entire Urals that has not been damaged by air raids. Otherwise it was an ordinary, old working shop. Some workers had already begun to get acquainted with the equipment and materials. Konstantin, on the other hand, went to find the foreman of the previous shift to clear up some issues and take over the shift."

Mostly lectures and speeches were given there by representatives of the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party. Sometimes local artists and musicians gave concerts there, and even more rarely, black and white films were shown there on an old projector. Recently, however, the palace became a little more lively. The right wing was given to the newly formed Ministry of Agitation and Propaganda, or, as it was nicknamed, "Agitprop".\n In the makeshift office, work was in full swing.\n Andrei, how many times are you going to rewrite the same text? We have to finish it by the end of the week, and the work has barely begun. You can spin it any way you want, but I have to have the text on my desk tonight, so we can send it to the printer tomorrow," said the head of the department.\n- If it doesn't go, it doesn't go, so what am I going to do?" - Andrei objected.\n- It's coming! Yes, it will! Along with Trutov's pussyfooting around our souls. It's no longer my demand, but the Central Committee's, and the sooner we deal with it, the better. Because right now they need a company against Rokossovsky, and then you know, we won't have so much time...\n- Okay, okay! - Andrei waved his hands, trying to reassure his superiors.

Then your back just quacks, and they'll never take you anywhere," Sergei said sternly.\n-Shit! We can't sit here all our lives! We've even got a senior foreman under pressure, and how many of our guys have died right here! At the factory in the shop, not at the front! Yes. We used to sleep at work in the fifties, but there was at least some safety equipment. That Kaganovich, damn him! -said the oldest man in the company. \n- But the situation in Sverdlovsk is no better, as I know, and with Omsk it's obvious....\Why didn't you rush to Zlatoust then? Well, you try crossing the border first, and then walk through the mountains, no, I'd rather die here. Kolyan, where do you think it's better? You've only been working for a week. In the north, beyond Sverdlovsk... No, no, no! Vorkutlag is too much.... - he said thoughtfully...\n-Blokhin and his camp are no more. Vorkuta is now a state of workers and peasants. And who's at the head of it? Chairman Boris Kamkov... I haven't heard that name in a long time. I'm glad he's still alive, and he took Vorkuta for himself.

The frightened prisoners dropped what they were doing and rushed to the entrance, forming a line. \n "Please," - the guard let the people's militia officers inside. \n-Kurbatov Leonid Vyacheslavovich, step out of the line. - said one of the policemen. \n Kurbatov, step out of the line, quickly! - shouted the guard. \n An elderly gray-haired man stepped out of the ranks uncertainly and hoarsely squeezed out: "Я". \n You are accused of betraying the revolution and participating in the illegal arrest," the policeman took out a list and, running his eyes over it, continued, "in the illegal arrest of Cherepanov, Trutovsky, Proshyan, Kamkov, Karelin, Magerovsky, Blumkin, Andreev, Golubovsky, Mayorov, Fishman.

Today we're all here to talk about important things. I remember addressing you a few months ago. Back then we were entrenched in the North, in the deprived region which had just been freed from the shackles of the Vorkutlag, and we were ready to stand our ground to the death for the freedom of the Ural people. And we stood our ground! The people of the Urals defended their freedom! I thank all the people who, at our call, raised the banner of the revolution and entered into an unequal battle against the exploiters. Now no one will doubt our determination!

I take it they'll try to negotiate there peacefully, - Anton reassured him. \n For the first time in many years at least some issues will be solved without any weapons. I'm so sick of it all. Sometimes it seems like our work is never finished. But at the same time, when you see the gratitude of the people we help, you realize it's all worth it. There was silence for a couple of seconds.
