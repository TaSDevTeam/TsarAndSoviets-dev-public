 POLITICS_VASILY_BLOKHI_DESC: "Some men have strict moral codes. Vasily Mikhailovich Blokhin abandoned them long ago, when he became the chief executioner of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, the NKVD. His effectiveness in "wetwork" as a Cheka member would not go unnoticed, and so he would quickly gain a higher position. Blokhin's brutality was unmatched: he personally oversaw mass executions of "enemies of the state", from the most insignificant ones to those of the most prominent Bolsheviks in the history of the Soviet Union. Thousands would perish under his watch, yet he himself would manage to avoid being affected by any purges carried out.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War and the humiliating defeat of the USSR, Blokhin would not let his power go that easily. As chief of the Vorkutlag, a large gulag complex, he would exercise his power, initially as the face of the West Russian Revolutionary Front's authority. In reality, he did whatever he wanted to, and there was no one that could stop him, for they would be executed or mysteriously disappear. However, things would change with the rebellion of the gulag inmates against the guards: the formation of the dissident group of the Ural League put him in danger, but soon he would reign supreme once again as they fled southwards.\n\nVasily Blokhin was left to govern the gulags of Vorkuta, and now the city itself, on his own, especially as the WRRF crumbled with the famous West Russian War. With the help of what few guards remained, he would reorganize the area, and effectively set up his warlord state. However, Blokhin is not an ambitious man; all he wants is for his fiefdom to be left alone and survive, no matter what the cost for that may be."

It was with him both in the bright hours of the collapse of the autocracy and the convening of the Constituent Assembly, and in the dark moments of its dispersal with the rise to power of the Bolsheviks, traitors to the cause of socialism. \n\nDreams of Russia by and for the people burned brightly in him even when the bloodsuckers of the NKVD came after him, intending to leave him to rot forever in the frozen barracks of the Vorkutlag. No way. \n\nThe Bolshevik Union had fallen, unable to withstand the legions of Nazis. The Vorkutlag, no longer fed by the endless stream of prisoners of conscience, had also fallen. The torturers of true socialists on Russian soil have fallen. \n\nHenceforth, over the frozen wasteland flew the Red Banners with the slogans of the Left Socialist Social Revolutionaries resurrected from oblivion. Boris Kamkov, now leading the vanguard of the new Russian revolution in the weary Russian land, has also risen from oblivion. The dream of the people's kingdom of freedom and labor shines brighter than ever, and Kamkov is confident that it will henceforth, never shrink to a faint candle in his ever-burning heart."

Even the end of the existence of their former rulers is not a reason to stop their service, and therefore the chief executive continues what was prescribed to him by Bukharin.\n\nGULags, despite their small number, produce a lot of products that go to different needs. However, the fall of the USSR led to the general decline of Russia, which also affected Vorkuta. Life in these places is hard, but only for prisoners, who make up the vast majority of the population. The other half of the population are camp guards who make sure that no one escapes or completes, and they clearly live better than others.\n\nThe next camp reporting period is coming. They collect all the data and information about the income and expenses of this whole small state. What can change here?"
  
 vorkuta_start.1.t:0 "Camp Report"
 vorkuta_start.1.d:0 "Vasily Blokhin was drinking coffee and eating a rum woman while reading the report that had just been brought to him about the effectiveness of the camps. Initially, he did not even want to look at what was included in this report, because usually everything is always written the same way: how many died; how many forests and other useful resources were extracted; how many food supplies were left; income, expenses and a detailed list of camps with how many people were there.\n\n Usually, it all looked extremely monotonous. After the fall of Bukharin's USSR, things got much worse, but Kaganovich, while he was the head of the West Siberian Soviet Republic, was happy to use Vorkuta as a camp center, and therefore, even in these difficult days, he managed to catch a lot of criminals and dissidents. But after the collapse of the Kaganovich Republic, Blokhin remained, in fact, alone in Vorkuta, left to himself. Hundreds died from difficult conditions, dozens from executions. Somehow, Vorkuta lives, but Blokhin's power can be undermined by his camp guards, who are frankly not happy with the fact that Vasily did not do anything useful, and the prisoners, because everything goes not to provide citizens and prisoners, but to ensure the top authorities.Turning to the report, he began to pay attention to the fact that the number of victims and disobedience has increased. The bombing of the Nazis has recently been particularly painful for the camps, which from a height are very convenient targets. Free Aviators cannot always save Western Siberia, because this time the bombing is especially painful. And besides, over the past year, the supply of the camps themselves has deteriorated significantly, which is why cases of deaths from starvation have become more frequent, and those who survived are beginning to show obvious disobedience. Disobedience is especially scary, because it can lead to the collapse of the whole shaky "economy", if it can be said so, which is based on pumping out the last forces of prisoners and giving all property in favor of the NKVD.\n\n It seems that in order to stay in power it is necessary to do something. Blokhin was not happy about this, but he told his adjutant to start preparing papers for the publication of any decrees. Again."

Of course, there was no question of a professional installation and no one was going to keep them in good condition, and there were no people with such knowledge. The result was the natural wear of the machines, they seemed to feed on the hopelessness of this place. \n\n Here is Mikhail, he has never worked behind such walls before for such machines and had to learn on the go. He had heard that people had died a couple of times behind them, but what could he do, it was also impossible to shirk from work. And before it was tolerable, before the extension of the shift to the absurd, now I had to work until I was given the go-ahead personally, not even to orient myself by the sun. Mikhail's eyes were already starting to close when suddenly he felt something was wrong. \n\n And then everyone in the room heard the heart-rending scream of the victim. A piece of clothing caught on a moving part of the machine and pulled the hand into the working mechanism. When the overseers arrived, it was too late to do anything. The arm was amputated to the elbow and the worker himself was bleeding. After a shot was heard and the work went on as before."

But we had to go to extreme measures to solve them, and perhaps we would not have been able to just survive if not for our measures. \n\nHowever, according to the reports of the guards, after our measures, the dissatisfaction of the prisoners began to grow. And now news is being brought to Blokhin about particularly violent riots in the Special Camp No. 6 for political prisoners. It is urgent to send people to suppress the riots."

 vorkuta_start.7.d:0 "It was restless in the Special Camp this morning. According to the reports of the guards, two prisoners had already started a fight in the mine and officer Ivanov and his guards went to separate them. The guards themselves could not calm them down, because the prisoners began to constantly snap at them, and therefore more serious people are needed, like the same officer Ivanov.The heavy tense atmosphere of work and discontent was felt even in the air, not to mention just on an emotional level. The angry glances of the prisoners fell on the officer, and they could not do anything, even despite the numerical superiority of the first. In the end, they soon arrived at the place where the fight was taking place.\n\n"Well, stop your fucking dogs! Otherwise, I...", but then he heard the sounds of a struggle behind him and decided to turn around. Before the pickaxe pierced his skull, he managed to see that the guards behind him were already dead. Soon a wave of uprisings swept through the mine and now the NKVD officers were trying to leave it as soon as possible in order to regroup. Meanwhile, near the freight elevator, Boris Kamkov began his speech: "Comrades, illegally convicted by the Bukharin government! Today we will throw off the chains of slavery! Today we will fight back against the oppressors who hide behind the guise of workers and peasants! Today we will come out of the darkness! And our first step is to get the keys! And we got them!"."

The prisoners were able to get out of the mine and the uprising has already swept the entire camp. It was necessary to contact the headquarters urgently. And when the chief was about to recruit Blokhin, dirty, wild-eyed, and hate-filled prisoners burst into the office, who grabbed the head of the Special Camp and dragged him somewhere. \n\n Now all those 30 years that this camp has been working will be avenged. Who was nobody will become everything. Stepan was placed against the wall along with several other guards and immediately shot with a Maxim machine gun, which was removed from one of the towers of the camp. There wasn't much time to stand on ceremony, and they didn't want to. \n\n After a couple of minutes, a voice was heard from all the loudspeakers: \n"Comrades! The time has come to stand up against all those who have enslaved us! May they know the courage of the Russian people! We all shed blood for the Motherland! We have answered her call without a doubt! We gave our youth, our hearts, our very souls for her salvation! We fought side by side against the oppressors. We crawled through bloody mud, through waterless sands for the sake of our victory! Not for the sake of awards, not for the sake of fame! For the sake of a just cause! We wanted revenge! When the whites left, how did Bukharin repay us? Instead of gratitude, suspicion and persecution awaited us! In the eyes of our leaders, we were struck by the capitalist contagion! We were torn away from our loved ones and thrown here! Here — to this hell! Here we languished, not hoping for salvation, not hoping for justice! We worked in the mines of Blokhin until the flesh began to peel off the bones! We watched our comrades die of diseases, starve, beat! But we didn't break down! Today our cruel, dishonest leaders will receive our message! They will no longer live at the expense of the suffering and labor of the people! They can't buy the souls of good people! They will fall, but they will not forget about us! Today, comrades, Vorkuta will be engulfed in FLAMES!!!""

However, Blokhin found out that the prisoners now have military equipment, and then he took a handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his forehead. His time was slowly running out.Meanwhile, a special part of the NKVD was approaching the camp. The cars barely overcame the snow, but it was necessary to hurry. And so, when the NKVD soldiers of the unit began to unload and take up positions, a sudden thing happened. From the side of the camp, fire was opened from a fairly large caliber gun. One of the trucks was blown up, and when armored personnel carriers left the camp, the soldiers began to run away altogether. \n\nKamkov meanwhile bent over the map that he managed to get from the office of the camp manager. "So, here's the city and we need to take it, and to the south...?" - he squinted trying to make out the handwriting, all the marks were put on a Soviet map that was clearly not intended for the collapsed Union. "There is Yugra, they say that some bandits and thieves remained who managed to escape earlier," a prisoner nearby helped. "The state of thieves, it will not be the first time we will defeat it… Well, and now to Vorkuta!"."

Meanwhile, the uprising engulfed Vorkuta itself, the NKVD troops fought in the streets, but the forces were unequal. \n\n "At least they won't get me," Vasily Blokhin thought when he put a revolver to his temples. The abruptly opened door did not allow him to finish what he had started, his hand jerked and Blokhin himself lost his balance and fell from his chair. Armed men were already standing in the doorway and the security officer lying on the floor tried to reach for the revolver, but as soon as he stretched out his hand, one of the rioters stepped on it. Vasily's face immediately transformed. Meanwhile, the revolutionary said: "Comrade Blokhin, you are accused of high treason, and therefore you are going with us." The former camp manager only managed to squeeze out, "No, not like that." After that, he was forcibly dragged out of the office by two of the rebels who took hold of Blokhin's hands. "

The guards rot in the damp earth or hide in the woods like cornered animals. The revolution has taken place, and from now on the creation of the Workers' and Peasants' Republic of the Urals will be proclaimed! hooray comrades!"\n\nHowever, the speech was not received as positively as Kamkov had hoped. The front rows naturally raised their hands and began to chant "Hurrah!" but the shock of bewilderment was heard from behind. \n\nA man of Caucasian appearance came out of the crowd and with a noticeable accent began to say, "Listen, dear, you certainly speak beautifully, but think about it yourself, where did you see the peasants here? Which republic of the Urals? We would like to survive here and you're talking about a revolution." After that, the rumours in the crowd became louder and louder \n\n To everyone's surprise, another person appeared on the improvised stage. \n"Peasants and workers will be found when we liberate the Urals. And if we don't go to liberate, then tyrants will come here and send us all back to the camps or do something worse."Kamkov's gaze caught on something in this man.\n- Volodya, are you? Kamkov asked suddenly. \n- Ha, I haven't been called Volodya for a long time. But in general, yes, Karelin Vladimir Alexandrovich – the interlocutor tried to say cheerfully.\n- How many years.. \n- How many winters..."

The task is not easy, and yet it does not stop him. Everything great starts small: the newly created government of Free Vorkuta needs to establish at least a semblance of power over the wasteland. Delay in this matter threatens to end just as badly as it did for those who were hanged by his own orders. \n\nHenceforth, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries have a lot of work to do.

He probably needed to rest, but what kind of revolutionary would he be then, what would people say about him? He had to sit, plan, and now he had to help people, get them out of prison, and explain why their cause was right. Boris cleared his throat and went on stage. After standing in place for a while, he began, \"Comrades! Citizens, brothers, and sisters. We have been through a lot. Soviet power hindered us, drove its most loyal followers to the north.
