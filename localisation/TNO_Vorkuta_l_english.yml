 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_VASILY_BLOKHI_DESC: "Some men have strict moral codes. Vasily Mikhailovich Blokhin abandoned them long ago, when he became the chief executioner of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, the NKVD. His effectiveness in "wetwork" as a Cheka member would not go unnoticed, and so he would quickly gain a higher position. Blokhin's brutality was unmatched: he personally oversaw mass executions of "enemies of the state", from the most insignificant ones to those of the most prominent Bolsheviks in the history of the Soviet Union. Thousands would perish under his watch, yet he himself would manage to avoid being affected by any purges carried out.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second World War and the humiliating defeat of the USSR, Blokhin would not let his power go that easily. As chief of the Vorkutlag, a large gulag complex, he would exercise his power, initially as the face of the West Russian Revolutionary Front's authority. In reality, he did whatever he wanted to, and there was no one that could stop him, for they would be executed or mysteriously disappear. However, things would change with the rebellion of the gulag inmates against the guards: the formation of the dissident group of the Ural League put him in danger, but soon he would reign supreme once again as they fled southwards.\n\nVasily Blokhin was left to govern the gulags of Vorkuta, and now the city itself, on his own, especially as the WRRF crumbled with the famous West Russian War. With the help of what few guards remained, he would reorganize the area, and effectively set up his warlord state. However, Blokhin is not an ambitious man; all he wants is for his fiefdom to be left alone and survive, no matter what the cost for that may be."

 VOR_security_state_desc: "The state of Vorkuta made its origins with the NKVD officers sent to guard and survey the armies of prisoners of war, political prisoners, and violent criminals sent to pillage the vast resources of the region. From the era of the Front onwards, and past the West Russian War, the NKVD was granted free reign to rule the province as they saw fit, to maximize the crucial resources needed to keep the war machine in the West operational.\n\nOne can say they were cruel, and that they were brutal, perhaps unnecessarily so. But one cannot say that they were incompetent. The NKVD of Vorkuta, now swollen with volunteers and 'rehabilitated' prisoners is a formidable machine, with truly fearful capabilities in the field of combat, security, and intelligence-gathering."
 VOR_inhospitable_climate_desc: "Vorkuta's climate, to put it as lightly as anyone is likely to, is brutally cold and unforgiving. In many parts of the region, permafrost cakes the ground, agriculture is impossible, and hunting is unfruitful. Unwinterized equipment is liable to freeze, and ill-prepared soldiers are liable to suffer. To fight in these harsh conditions is not a prospect one should take lightly, or approach with anything other than caution and acceptance of the dangers involved."

 VOR_otchet:0 "Reporting Period"
 VOR_otchet_desc:0 "Ever since Bukharin's USSR and the united West Siberian Soviet Republic ended their existence, Vasily Blokhin continued his work as the chief manager of the entire system, called "Vorkutgulag". Even the end of the existence of their former rulers is not a reason to stop their service, and therefore the chief executive continues what was prescribed to him by Bukharin.\n\nGULags, despite their small number, produce a lot of products that go to different needs. However, the fall of the USSR led to the general decline of Russia, which also affected Vorkuta. Life in these places is hard, but only for prisoners, who make up the vast majority of the population. The other half of the population are camp guards who make sure that no one escapes or completes, and they clearly live better than others.\n\nThe next camp reporting period is coming. They collect all the data and information about the income and expenses of this whole small state. What can change here?"
  
 vorkuta_start.1.t:0 "Camp Report"
 vorkuta_start.1.d:0 "Vasily Blokhin was drinking coffee and eating a rum woman while reading the report that had just been brought to him about the effectiveness of the camps. Initially, he did not even want to look at what was included in this report, because usually everything is always written the same way: how many died; how many forests and other useful resources were extracted; how many food supplies were left; income, expenses and a detailed list of camps with how many people were there.\n\n Usually, it all looked extremely monotonous. After the fall of Bukharin's USSR, things got much worse, but Kaganovich, while he was the head of the West Siberian Soviet Republic, was happy to use Vorkuta as a camp center, and therefore, even in these difficult days, he managed to catch a lot of criminals and dissidents. But after the collapse of the Kaganovich Republic, Blokhin remained, in fact, alone in Vorkuta, left to himself. Hundreds died from difficult conditions, dozens from executions. Somehow, Vorkuta lives, but Blokhin's power can be undermined by his camp guards, who are frankly not happy with the fact that Vasily did not do anything useful, and the prisoners, because everything goes not to provide citizens and prisoners, but to ensure the top authorities.Turning to the report, he began to pay attention to the fact that the number of victims and disobedience has increased. The bombing of the Nazis has recently been particularly painful for the camps, which from a height are very convenient targets. Free Aviators cannot always save Western Siberia, because this time the bombing is especially painful. And besides, over the past year, the supply of the camps themselves has deteriorated significantly, which is why cases of deaths from starvation have become more frequent, and those who survived are beginning to show obvious disobedience. Disobedience is especially scary, because it can lead to the collapse of the whole shaky "economy", if it can be said so, which is based on pumping out the last forces of prisoners and giving all property in favor of the NKVD.\n\n It seems that in order to stay in power it is necessary to do something. Blokhin was not happy about this, but he told his adjutant to start preparing papers for the publication of any decrees. Again."

Among them was Boris Kamkov, who was not how he imagined life after the revolution, oh not so. But everything started so well, all these words about freedom, equality, brotherhood, revolution. These slogans attracted working people and Kamkov was imbued with them at the time. Only the Bolsheviks had their own vision of the revolution, and after their betrayal, the ideas of a free society could be forgotten. The founder of the PLSR party was particularly unlucky, Boris was one of the first to go to “master” the riches of Siberia. Only here there was no peace. First, Bukharin's policy with the development of Siberia. \n\n A then and the death of the Union. It also seems like there was a second war, but no one knows here anymore. Life outside the camp seemed like something distant, incomprehensible. Only some planes flew nearby constantly. "And why are they doing this? Is the war still going on?" he thought to himself sometimes. But there was still hope in his soul. One day people will rise up and then the idea of a real workers' state will be remembered again!

God knows where they are being taken, there was even a rumor around the camp a couple of times that they were neutralizing minefields. But in general, what's the difference? Their fate is no longer our concern when they came out, and the Communists regularly pay. \n\n If there are people we can sell, then we have a chance for the survival of our little camp management."

 vorkuta_start.3.d:0 "A pair of battered trucks with characteristic red stars were parked near the battered prison building. This institution has been standing here since the time of Bukharin. They shot at him and dropped bombs nearby, and did everything they could with this building, but he still stands. \n- Well, where are they there? – one of the drivers said angrily. \n- Yes, the devil knows. Maybe they were cut there, or better they got away with our money and that's it, phew, goodbye. The man in the raincoat replied.\n- Can also be. \n\n Suddenly a voice was heard from the cold corridor, - "P-went to whom it was said! Are you deaf there or what? I'm going to insert such a pussy right now, you won't get a mop!" \n\n The man in the raincoat smiled. After that, a line of people came out of the building, among whom a couple in a black uniform with pistols clearly stood out. "And now quickly get into the truck!" one of them said loudly, and the prisoners obeyed. \n- Yes, Vasily Ivanovich, it's been a long time this time.\n- Yes, fuck, one deaf person got caught or the fuck knows what's wrong with him there, didn't want to go, had to add motivation to him. \n- Yeah, you don't change. Well, look, everything is as usual. Trunks, valuables are all in boxes, your people have already taken away. \n- And it's nice to do business with you. Not like the Kalashnikov dealers. \n- Well, Vasily Ivanovich, we are honest people. We Communists do not deceive each other – after which he winked. \n Both burst out laughing, then shook hands and dispersed. And the cars with red stars left for the icy wasteland. "

A house, a wife, a couple of sons and a farm. And then... then the war came. His wife was gone, his sons died in the war. It was then that Ivan realized how terrible the war had become. Not those campaigns of soldiers in beautiful outfits, not those glorious knights that he read about in textbooks, but a real war is a war when brother goes against brother. \n\n When they approached the cage, Ivan did not even think about getting up, all his thoughts were about the unfulfilled past. Damn this war! Damn the Bolsheviks and the tsar, they took away his life, replaced it with an existence in the camp, and now what? Now he has become just a commodity, his life is not worth much. And it was never worth it. \n\n When they took him and naturally dragged him to the others, he did not move. Only a strong blow to the back of the head brought him to his senses.\n\n "Maybe I fell asleep then and it's just a dream? Or was I killed in the war then, who will survive a shell explosion so close? Only then it turns out that I'm in hell," Ivan thought to himself.

And so, in one modestly equipped room, two guards of the institution, Stas and Zhenya, were sitting. Cigarette smoke was a frequent decoration and even a broken window, which was never completely closed, could not neutralize all the smoke. \n- Hey, Zhen, let's play cards or something, there's nothing to do anyway – Vasiliev turned.\n- Yes... mmm, I won't be shorter.\n- What's wrong? \n- Yes, shifts have been increased for prisoners, and for us at work, too. I came back half an hour ago and I have to go out again in an hour and a half. Damn him.\n- Ah, that's how it is in your production, we have nothing new. \n- I literally had a case not long ago... my arm was cut off by one elbow with a machine. Well, what else are you going to do with him? I had to shoot him, he screamed... he also fucked up the machine, the creature. \n- For such a boss will definitely not stroke. \n- Yes, let them put their hand, which they stroke, in the ass, I've been guarding convicts for 30 years, what kind of life is this. \n\n The interlocutor just shrugged his shoulders and threw the cigarette out the window, it fell on the white snow and instantly went out."

Prisoners would have to make felt boots and other items of clothing for correction. But the wars made their own adjustments and it was decided to place some of the machines for the production of weapons here. Of course, there was no question of a professional installation and no one was going to keep them in good condition, and there were no people with such knowledge. The result was the natural wear of the machines, they seemed to feed on the hopelessness of this place. \n\n Here is Mikhail, he has never worked behind such walls before for such machines and had to learn on the go. He had heard that people had died a couple of times behind them, but what could he do, it was also impossible to shirk from work. And before it was tolerable, before the extension of the shift to the absurd, now I had to work until I was given the go-ahead personally, not even to orient myself by the sun. Mikhail's eyes were already starting to close when suddenly he felt something was wrong. \n\n And then everyone in the room heard the heart-rending scream of the victim. A piece of clothing caught on a moving part of the machine and pulled the hand into the working mechanism. When the overseers arrived, it was too late to do anything. The arm was amputated to the elbow and the worker himself was bleeding. After a shot was heard and the work went on as before."

 vorkuta_start.7.d:0 "It was restless in the Special Camp this morning. According to the reports of the guards, two prisoners had already started a fight in the mine and officer Ivanov and his guards went to separate them. The guards themselves could not calm them down, because the prisoners began to constantly snap at them, and therefore more serious people are needed, like the same officer Ivanov.The heavy tense atmosphere of work and discontent was felt even in the air, not to mention just on an emotional level. The angry glances of the prisoners fell on the officer, and they could not do anything, even despite the numerical superiority of the first. In the end, they soon arrived at the place where the fight was taking place.\n\n"Well, stop your fucking dogs! Otherwise, I...", but then he heard the sounds of a struggle behind him and decided to turn around. Before the pickaxe pierced his skull, he managed to see that the guards behind him were already dead. Soon a wave of uprisings swept through the mine and now the NKVD officers were trying to leave it as soon as possible in order to regroup. Meanwhile, near the freight elevator, Boris Kamkov began his speech: "Comrades, illegally convicted by the Bukharin government! Today we will throw off the chains of slavery! Today we will fight back against the oppressors who hide behind the guise of workers and peasants! Today we will come out of the darkness! And our first step is to get the keys! And we got them!"."

Who was nobody will become everything. Stepan was placed against the wall along with several other guards and immediately shot with a Maxim machine gun, which was removed from one of the towers of the camp. There wasn't much time to stand on ceremony, and they didn't want to. \n\n After a couple of minutes, a voice was heard from all the loudspeakers: \n"Comrades! The time has come to stand up against all those who have enslaved us! May they know the courage of the Russian people! We all shed blood for the Motherland! We have answered her call without a doubt! We gave our youth, our hearts, our very souls for her salvation! We fought side by side against the oppressors. We crawled through bloody mud, through waterless sands for the sake of our victory! Not for the sake of awards, not for the sake of fame! For the sake of a just cause! We wanted revenge! When the whites left, how did Bukharin repay us? Instead of gratitude, suspicion and persecution awaited us! In the eyes of our leaders, we were struck by the capitalist contagion! We were torn away from our loved ones and thrown here! Here — to this hell! Here we languished, not hoping for salvation, not hoping for justice! We worked in the mines of Blokhin until the flesh began to peel off the bones! We watched our comrades die of diseases, starve, beat! But we didn't break down! Today our cruel, dishonest leaders will receive our message! They will no longer live at the expense of the suffering and labor of the people! They can't buy the souls of good people! They will fall, but they will not forget about us!

His time was slowly running out.Meanwhile, a special part of the NKVD was approaching the camp. The cars barely overcame the snow, but it was necessary to hurry. And so, when the NKVD soldiers of the unit began to unload and take up positions, a sudden thing happened. From the side of the camp, fire was opened from a fairly large caliber gun. One of the trucks was blown up, and when armored personnel carriers left the camp, the soldiers began to run away altogether. \n\nKamkov meanwhile bent over the map that he managed to get from the office of the camp manager. "So, here's the city and we need to take it, and to the south...?" - he squinted trying to make out the handwriting, all the marks were put on a Soviet map that was clearly not intended for the collapsed Union.

The abruptly opened door did not allow him to finish what he had started, his hand jerked and Blokhin himself lost his balance and fell from his chair. Armed men were already standing in the doorway and the security officer lying on the floor tried to reach for the revolver, but as soon as he stretched out his hand, one of the rioters stepped on it. Vasily's face immediately transformed. Meanwhile, the revolutionary said: "Comrade Blokhin, you are accused of high treason, and therefore you are going with us."
