 berez_world_news.5.d:0 "The first news has just arrived of the cessation of all Nazi resistance to the troops of the Russian People's Kingdom. The act of unconditional surrender was signed overnight and the full text will soon be published, but we already know that with the surrender the Nazi reign, which began over 30 years ago, ends.\n\nIn the end of the war between Germany and Russia in favor of the latter gives us a clear indication that the situation in world politics has shifted dramatically in the direction of the OSN. But it is not yet clear what the Russian People's Kingdom will do next, and it is not known how these circumstances will affect the course of the Cold War in the future."

Fighting on various scales is taking place all along the front line from the Caspian Sea to the Tian Shan ranges. \n\n the scattered warlords of Central Asia suffer one defeat after another. Russian troops have already advanced 20 kilometers from the borders in some areas. \n\n Afghanistan and Japan condemned the "barbaric attack on the free peoples" and demanded an immediate withdrawal.

Despite some issues, the main list of agreements satisfied both sides, which put an end to the Russian campaign in Central Asia. \n\nIn the near future, Russia will establish its administration in the freshly recaptured territories, and Afghanistan will withdraw its troops from the predominantly Tajik-populated border areas."

Achieving a Pyrrhic victory, the army could not defeat the rebels before they spread their word into the countryside. \n\nThe Manchurian military maintained control of the southeast and completed regrouping, Harbin and the north proved loyal to the democratic movement, and another group of rebels, the so-called Total Liberation Front of Manchuria, took Mukden and territories south of it."

But he was constantly forced to change them because of the defeat. But the executioners couldn't take his soul. \n\nAs soon as Russian forces entered Poland, he realized that it was time to act. Warsaw flamed up again and the Germans fled, away from Polish soil. In general, he was a perfect compromise between the interests of the people's and the national armies, so his appointment as the leader of Poland was not considered in Moscow for a long time.

However, under the Mladorosses he was able to recover and was even able to participate in research again. \n\nAfter the fall of Germany, he sent the Imperial government a plan for the renewal of Prussia. And this plan was gladly accepted. Now the homeland of German unification would become a de facto part of the reborn Russian kingdom.

He joined the Polish Army immediately after World War I, he enshrined the Polish administration in Vilnius. But in 1939 his world was shattered. He became a fighter, he became a member of the Krajowa Army.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded London, he had no choice but to flee. He found his new home in New York, but even there his faith in his homeland did not fade. Finally, in the '50s, the Russians struck in Germany, revealing the Achilles' heel of that colossus - partisan movements. Together with the Krajowa Army, Muzyczka left for his homeland, where he set up the "Shadow State". Fortunately, the new German regime had no time to destroy its prisoners. Muzyczka held on, withstanding blow after blow. And then the Russians came, and all hell broke loose. Poland returned as free as ever, and Muzyczka was given a new role, so similar to the one that fell to him after World War I: the return of Silesia to its native Polish Harbor.nIn this time Muzyczka will not allow a repeat of the Polish Tragedy."

Did the common soldier Vladimir know that the West Russian War would end in a complete collapse of the old regime? No. \n\nBut does the past mean that much? It can only be viewed through the prism of one's own perception. And it's very hard for Vladimir to look back. But history is not subject to the subjunctive mood. Of course Gil could become a martyr and a hero of the Union posthumously. Rodion would have been a pawn of the corporation based in Tambov. And Vladimir could have been a hero-liberator of the Soviet Union.

Hundreds of thousands of ruined lives now hang in his balance, like holographic marks on a card. Those he could not save, those who died in his crusade of fools, those whom he left behind on his path to the throne... All these sacrifices turned out to be in vain. He is the murderer of Russian hope.{nOnly with such a burden on his shoulders is the choice between the bottle or the noose. Sergei Sergeyevich, to his shame, chose the bottle. It is shame that fuels his endless binge drinking, and the desire to escape from this bitter feeling that forces him to down another shot. There is no escape from nothingness. There are only endless cycles of guilt."
 POLITICS_RUTSKOJ_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Despair. Bargaining. And finally, Anger. \n\nThese were the very feelings Alexander Rutskoi was experiencing as he watched the reports from the fronts of the new Patriotic War. Russian guys were dying under the bombing and artillery fire because of incompetence of the Mladorussian command, while Rutskoi was forced to deal with the problems of savages in the steppe. Last time he was still a baby, but now he will try to save Russia from itself.

 POLITICS_BEK_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "If only he had known how things would turn out in the end, maybe Kazem-Bek would never have organized the Young Russians and would have continued writing books about religion and pining for a lost Russia. But he couldn't, and for the sake of honesty he couldn't. Homesickness. \n\nIn betraying his country and joining the forces of Tsar Vladimir, Alexander put an end to his destiny. At the time when Russia was uniting and strengthening he forgot about his deeds. But as always, the road to hell was paved with good intentions. \n\nAnd now the leader of Mladorossov is sitting in Berezniki again, depressed and devastated, he doesn't know what he should do next.

At a time when victory in the war seemed in his hands, fate destroyed that dream, and then did it again, already in the Western Russian War. Byerly seemed to have found his place in life when he joined the Young Russians. Reaching the position of Tsar Belozersky's favorite general, he became the tip of the spear that was to smash the colossus of Europe... \n\nThis all turned to ashes in an instant. Now the Czar General is dead, and his general is certain that the only culprit is Kazembek, the head of the traitorous Mladorosses. Byerly no longer cares about the fate of Russia or the necessary sacrifices. His goal is to clear the good name of his comrade-in-arms, to avenge the murderers of the Tsar, and to allow the descendants of Belozersky to rule Russia... Whatever it may be."

First the Reds, then the Germans, then the Reds again, the forces of Tsar Vladimir and finally the Mladorosses, time after time he thought that he had seized fate by the tail and finally won. However, each time fate proved that it knows how to joke. \n\nMaybe then, during the Second Western Russian War, when Gil's headquarters came under artillery fire, Vladimir really died, his mind fading and dissolving amidst machine gun fire, shouts on the battlefield, and endless artillery strikes. In spite of this, the general's body continued to walk, in spite of fate, in spite of the world, and in spite of intelligent design.  \n\nAnd it's not going to stop."

 MAR_Collapse.1.d:0 "For the last few days no one saw Sergei Sergeyevich. He locked himself in his office, periodically asking for more and more bottles of Vyatka from his supplies. However, for the past twelve hours he has not done this either. The guards did not dare to go in as they were well aware that in this state of mind the Tsar could without hesitation order anyone to be shot for no apparent reason. The defeat in the war had a great effect on Belozersky's mental state, as it probably did on the state of all the inhabitants of Russia. His dreams of a just retribution and a long and happy life were shattered like a shot glass of still unfinished vodka falling from the weakened tsar's hand. The sound of the broken glass was probably the last sound that Sergei Belozersky heard before he finally lost consciousness. \n\nFourteen hours later the guards decided to enter the cabinet. They were faced with a rather pitiful sight. The whole room was littered with bottles of varying degrees of content, especially many on the desk. In addition to the bottles and shot glasses the Tsar was lying on the table. The soldiers, smelling something amiss, having asked a few questions without getting an answer, decided to go closer to the body and check for a pulse. There was no pulse. The doctor, who arrived at lightning speed, after a brief unpretentious check, stated:"

Antipin shouted the loudest, or rather squealed: "Repent! Repent before it's too late! You're all lost! Do you hear? You're all lost!" \n\nWhen one of the ministers who hadn't yet gone into a frenzy tried to stop the overexcited priest, he took a huge cross off his chest and charged him in the forehead. The minister, who clearly had not been prepared for this in his life, immediately fainted. \n\nKazem-Bek, who decided it was time to end it all, thought of shooting his service weapon into the ceiling, but realized that it was no longer on the table where it had been kept. \n\nWhen he looked at the bacchanalia going on, he saw the only person sitting quietly and not getting into any kind of altercation with anyone. He was sitting in the corner of the office with a smile on his lips, unlocking his service weapon, which belonged to Alexander Lvovich. He was about to stop him, but did not have time. A mixture of blood and brains splattered the wall. \n\nAt the sound of the gunshot the guards came and stopped the brawl, and Kazem-Bek, who had returned to his office, started thinking about what to do next."

Perhaps by controlling all the minutiae Maria tried to distract herself from the frightening thoughts about her future fate. How much war can change people's lives. Especially the defeats in it. Not long ago it had seemed that the Vyatka's life would last forever, and now they had to go to the other continent in the hope that they could at least get by there. \n\nAll this thinking had kept her awake for the past week.

There was an explosion and the sound of flying glass - a grenade exploded nearby and blew out the shop windows. The woman shuddered. She could hardly keep from bursting into tears. Yesterday's best candy store in the capital was in ruins, and the BMP drove over the cake that had been in the window in the morning, but now spilled over the sidewalk. \n\nSuddenly the loudspeakers started blaring. The voice coming out of them was familiar to almost everyone. \n\nAttention! Stop your senseless resistance! We are the lawful authority and the guarantor of the country's security! Anyone who surrenders voluntarily will be guaranteed life!" - Alexander Kazem-Bek's speech resounded loudly. \n\nOlga already knew this message by heart. It had been two days since the troops had entered the capital, though it seemed like a whole year. \n\nFifteen minutes later, when the rattle of the caterpillars was barely audible, she decided to leave the basement. When she saw what her life's work had become, the work her father had bequeathed her, who had given everything he had for this place to thrive, the woman turned pale, fell to her knees, and sobbed. "

However, the lucky people who grabbed the gifts of fortune were waiting at the door for the same ones who were trying to grab the blue bird by the tail. \n\nIn about 20 minutes the whole thing turned into a mass brawl. \n\nBut retired police captain Pronin, a lifelong law enforcement officer, had no intention of leaving things as they were. \n\nTaking his service pistol, the man went to the parking lot. He found a life-beaten truck there, smashed the glass with a brick he had found in the driveway, and, with some simple manipulation, started up the truck and drove it downtown. \n\nBefore he reached the crowd about 500 meters away, Pronin got out of the car and put the brick on the gas pedal. The 8 tons of steel crashed at high speed first into the crowds, who had not had time to disperse, and then rammed through the door, blocking the passage to the station. Pronin, who came closer, looked at the shocked crowd; the crowd looked back. \n\nThe man pulled out a cigarette and a gun. The cigarette lit up. The safety clicked."

With the constant changes of power, little had changed except the banner over his place of work and the modification of the AK by his racketeers. However, by his thirty-five, he had had enough of it. Fortunately the program of "Development of the Steppe", de facto russification of the Kazakh bureaucracy, came to hand. Life was just as leisurely, perhaps more stable. He felt that he was not just a cog in Kazakhstan. \n\nBut stability is not the most stable thing. The defeat of the Russians in the European campaign was followed by mass uprisings, political wrangling, chaos. And then it all went silent when Rutskoi's military mandate in the south began to stir.

But today, today was a special day— the Decree on Denazification signed a week ago finally came into force and it is only right that the leader of the GUOT should have been personally present at the event. \n\nGil pulled on his jacket and went out into the street, entering his car's backseat. Germania now looked much less friendly than usual, but it didn't matter anymore. As the Germanmade car moved, the GUOT leader noticed all the marks the fascists; street names, plaques, or still-standing monuments, the biggest of which-the Volkshalle—imposed upon the horizon."

The majestic building was noticeably battered, artillery and air raids broke through the roof in several places, and the eagle, which previously towered at the very top, lying broken near the entrance. Nevertheless, the building still inspired some feeling of trepidation even in this state. "They certainly knew something about architecture," Gil thought to himself as he approached the zone where the main show was supposed to take place, at a safe distance where all kinds journalists, photographers, and ordinary onlookers gathered to look at the end of the majestic building. Security, of course, did not allow anyone to be close enough but the very sight of journalists made Gil sick. As soon as he joined the crowd, a young woman immediately approached him in the company of an operator, his camera etched with hieroglyphs that Gil could not even read, much less understand. "Hello, dear viewers, now we have Vladimir Gil, head of the German Office of the Occupied Territories and proponent behind the so-called, Denazification Decree. One of the major points is the demolition of the 'People's Hall' seen before us, do you want to add something on this?" Asked the presenter of the state TV channel, offering a microphone to Vladimir. \n\nLeaning slightly, Gil began to speak: "Yes-today, as part of Denazification efforts, the Volkshalle will be demolished, afterwhich denazification will begin in full force, eliminating all manners of monuments, the names of institutions of streets, and all other references to the fuhrers and national-socialism as a whole. There will also be trials of NDSAP members and their accomplices, historical injustice will be corrected." Finishing, he smiled and turned to the sappers, already waiting in position. Under the spotlight of both foreign and Russian journalists the lead sapper ceremonially approached Gil, saluting. "The sappers have carried out the order, waiting for further instructions!" \n\nGil picturesquely took a few steps forward, raised his right arm, and reported; "At my command! One, Two, Three!" Afterwhich he waved his raised arm to the sight of explosives devices detonating simultaneously, bringing down the beams and pillars of the structure afterwhich it fell, seamlessly dissolving into the ground with a large shook, a large wave of dust appearing afterward. Observing the situation for a few more moments, Vladimir Gil spares no time, lifting his feet and returning to his car-there is work to do."

While bullets from Tsarist guards restraining the protests reached him first and he was unable to run far from arrest, the suicide-explosion that he did reached the guards and some protestors, luckily having been done some distance from the cars. Soon, firearm shots rang from the buildings and crowds, a clear sign of a Werewolf ambush. \n\nThe skirmish did not last long, and the ill-equipped fanatics cannot surpass protecting Tsarist troops.

Liberated people are then given first-aid medical assistance if neccesary and a survey to clarify their previous place of residence, after which they will be sent home by train. \n\nThus, many Czechs, Poles, Jews, Russians, and many more are given a better world, second chance and a ticket home. But not everyone was equally lucky, and many could no longer be saved. The Russians come as liberators, but many can never see this liberation."

Is there even a point in it? \n\nThese are questions often lingered upon by the Central European Garrison's esteemed leader, but not today. Today, he is faced upon a special condition, and certainly a justified one. The man he is faced with are not conscripts, and not even concentration camp guards. No, they are a mix of reichskommissars, gauleiters, collaborators, and other disguting filth: architects of genocide and the industrialists gladly supporting them. The court had given their verdict, and now it is up to Beyrle for the direct administration of some well-needed justice. \n\nPerhaps he can make them suffer—just as they had inflicted to the millions-but by then, how will his liberators differ from these... monsters in human skin? Certainly it is God's duty to see to them, but his to send them up nonetheless. He took out his pistol, extended his right arm, and took aim, along with the squad at his command."

Power had previously stripped the honest veteran of everything he held dear, all starting with the two world wars and descending into the west russian war, the civil war, and now, the russian occupation of his fatherland. Said Russians had come, bombed his house, and hanged an old aquaintance, leaving the man with nothing but to live on. \n\not only do they bombed his house, but also the plumbing. While they had promised to eventually repair it-good of them-they shouldn't have broke it in the first place, and he personally doubted their promises. And so Hans now walked daily, carrying buckets of water back from a nearby well. On one of his daily trips, he in interrupted by a severe back pain, forcing him to gently lower his buckets, tried to straighten up, and re-lift the bucket, when he caught glance of an oncoming russian soldier, looking at the old man with some confusion. Already heard of what the soldiers did to german civilians—robbing, killing, or even raping for fun-he took a few steps back, obviously not boding well. It was supposedly as revenge for what his nation did twice, but that was already so long ago! \n\nThe soldier broke the running thoughts in his head, asking if he needed any assistance. \n\nHans did not understand russian however, and it seems that the soldier didn't understand German either. Thus, he shook his head and pointed at his ears warily: it isn't the clearest way to display his misunderstanding, but he didn't think of it at the fear of the moment. \n\nInstead of any fantasies Old Hans might have gotten, the soldier simply shrugged, raised the buckets, and shook his head questioningly. Hans stood still for awhile, then pointed to his house with his hand, as the soldier silently walked to such direction, the old man trotting after him. \n\nSomething is certainly wrong here—the soldier didn't seem to resemble the brutish mongoloid the newspapers told him. Is it a ruse? Propaganda? Maybe an act of kindness, only to be shown as tyranny? Hans thought, his head hurting. Perhaps those questions should maybe be directed to the fatherland he blindly served for so long, instead of people he had never even met? He knew the nazis lied, so why is it beyond reason to think that they lied here too? Why is it so hard to believe such? \n\nOld Hans began to break, tears threatening to roll out. As the Russian soldier placed down his buckets of water, he turned around and wiped some sweat, smiling. Hans observed him closely-the man is young—not much older than the average Germam conscript, so what is the difference anyways?

Never again—they are certainly the root of all our problems." \n\n"Therefore, I am obliged to announce the creation of our force of protectors—of National Security Battalions, true heroes of the state. These formations will have the power to evict and move the colonizing German away from their stolen homes into special camps located outside cities, but fear not: when you meet them in your daily duties in the reconstruction of our beloved nation, DO NOT discourage them, for they perform a sacred duty! A duty to clean the Czech State of the German taint, assisted by efforts of Degermanization and Denazification through all manners of places and peoples, but also particularly in languange.

Reactions are mixed—some moved to celebrate, others to flee. Yet, all are distracted by fanfares that are heard through the nation, men of the newly formed National Security Battalions proudly passing down streets, dragging with them Germans of all age and sex out of town.

A special effort was made by propaganda, which urged ordinary citizens to stand in solidarity with the troops. Finally, hours before the operation began, a decree was read out at the battalion locations to deprive them of criminal responsibility for killing Germans who resisted the expulsion. \n\nAnd then, at last, this day came. After Alois Grebenicek announced the beginning of the operation, pogroms against the Germans began throughout Bohemia. According to a prearranged plan of action, the battalions began to act. Breaking down the door of an apartment or a house, they drove the Germans out into the street. Resisting Germans were shot on the spot. They were formed into columns and driven to the border, disregarding casualties among the Germans. The main objective, to expel the Germans from the Czech Republic, was carried out by any means necessary. \n\nBy morning, Operation Czech Night was over. At least, its first stage was over. Now several problems had to be dealt with: the Germans had to be driven out of the Czech territory quickly. Each battalion had five trucks for this purpose. The Germans were crammed into them as much as possible and driven to the nearest border.

But the forces were unequal, and therefore all the Germans were systematically shot. This turned the former Wehrmacht soldiers into a frenzy, which is why Kurt Knispel put his own men into insurrection. \n\nThe training of his soldiers, their caches of weapons and their motivation enabled them to successfully fight the Czech troops. But to act in daylight in enemy-controlled territory was veritable suicide. That is why his unit decided to go into partisanship. Small counterattacks on National Security units bore fruit - the unit grew rapidly and initiated skirmishes with the enemy not only at night but also during the day. \n\nIt soon got to the point where all Czech military formations in the Sudetenland were attacked by Knispel's troops. Because of that they were forced to leave the Sudetes, the "Česká Noche" operation there was hastily curtailed. For now, Grebenicek is in no hurry to send his troops into the trap and is waiting for Knispel to make a mistake. The latter, in turn, adheres to the same tactic.

But we know there's still a lot of work to be done," Meinhof said. \n\nWe need to start a new wave of propaganda.

 TaS_GEREpilogue.21.d: "It was a hectic night near the Westphalian border, with a bunch of uniformed men bustling about in the woods at the edge of the forest. Among them were several former Reich officers, soldiers and even one very decent-looking industrialist. Late at night, however, they tried to sit as quietly as possible so as not to attract the attention of the Bavarian military. \n\nTime passed slowly and they were beginning to get nervous. The young officer, Heinrich, approached his old acquaintance, Siegfried, they had served together in the German army, fighting in the Civil War and the Second West Russian War. \n\nDo you think," Heinrich began, "that maybe he ditched us, took the money and took off. \n\nLook, I've known Max for a long time, he's moved a lot of people across the border, don't worry. \n\nHe's been gone a long time, I think someone's watching. \n\nBuddy, it's just nerves. It'll be fine. Maybe you're right. \n\nHenrich sighed and even calmed down a little bit when suddenly the clearing came alive. It all started with a single shot in the air, then the glade was retreated by the armed men. Eventually all those who tried to escape were loaded into a truck with the symbols of the Bavarian State. Max stood nearby and watched the whole thing. Did he feel guilty about it? No, he was taking revenge on the Nazis, would he continue to do so? Yes, he won't forget what they did to Maya, ever."

Without a break, without a rest, he sat at the piano in the dilapidated house and played. He pressed the same keys every fifteen minutes. He could not stop, even though the skin on his fingers was almost worn off he continued, if suddenly he stopped doing it he would be shot. The patrols of the Bavarian forces changed several times, I think it was the fifth. \n\nHis head was throbbing and his eyes were watering, but he kept going. Around him stood them, soldiers, unwashed and unshaven, not long ago they had been slaves, and now they stood over him. They laughed, they cheered, the music clearly pleased their ears, but their strength was running out and soon the former Reich soldier would be unconscious. \n\nAnd then he couldn't help himself, he couldn't take it anymore. "Please... let me go... I was just a driver... I... I'm sorry," the unwilling musician shouted. Soon he felt someone pat him on the shoulder. Through the humming in his head he heard, "Calm down. And then with difficulty he raised his head and opened his tear-shrouded eyes and saw the barrel of a gun pointed directly at him. In just a moment the white keys were covered in blood mixed with the remains of the Nazi's skull. "We'll have to tell the next one that the concert is over," pronounced one of the soldiers. "Yeah, he was starting to falsify towards the end anyway," said the other one. So the squad left the building leaving the musician lying on the floor, the next patrol will take the body."

No, no, it was more complicated than that. Goddamn Baader was never anti-Nazi. He put on the red cape and remained a bastard, only to become a red-brown bastard. \n\nIt can't go on. It can't! If bloody Baader thinks he can plunge Germany into barbarism again he's wrong... very wrong. Franz got up abruptly from his desk and went to an emergency meeting with the generals. "If the damn Nazis are serious about taking revenge, I'll teach them a lesson.

He had seen its rise and its catastrophic fall, and no longer expected to return to his native land. But fate had decided otherwise. He was greeted by a crowd of people who were genuinely happy for him. "How glad I am to be back," Otto said, wiping away a tear of happiness. \n\nRight at the gate, they put him in a luxury car. The joyful Austrians ran after the car, but it quickly sped away from them. "Congratulations on your return, Otto," the MP said, "there's a lot of work to be done." Otto, in a show of support, nodded. As we approached the airport, King got out of the car and walked through all the stages of the arrival, thus showing that he was just as ordinary as he was. \n\nFrom there, Otto saw the most interesting thing of all: a dozen or so soldiers and a crowd supporting them were tearing down a monument to Adolf Hitler. Journalists immediately ran up to King and asked for his opinion on this event. Otto was silent and went to his waiting car. \n\nAlready in the car, he told the driver that he was proud of the people who were destroying the memory of this "scum of society. The driver agreed and said he was also involved in the denazification of Austria. Otto praised him and they drove the rest of the time in complete silence.

He got dressed and left the parliament building and headed for the park. \n\nThe weather was beautiful and Otto was immersed in his dreams. And in them he saw a powerful union of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, together surviving the crises. He saw monarchy as the best form of government for all of Europe. He pondered the reasons that led to the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I and that if they had won, the world would not have seen the horrors of Nazism and Fascism. \n\nHe had forgotten all about the time. It was almost 10 p.m. In his hurry back to life, he headed home. Walking through the streets of his beloved Vienna, he involuntarily thought about other cities. Berlin, the capital of the world, had been transformed by Albert Speer into an ugly concrete colossus whose main purpose was to demonstrate the power of the Nazis. Rome suffered much less under the Nazis, but was nevertheless also turned into a "show of force capital". But it is amazing how well preserved Vienna is. Its old streets with their alleys and nooks still reminded him of the old days of the Austro-Hungarian Union. \n\nUnWhen he got home, he looked at Vienna and realized..."

As he was writing his report to the accounting department, a panting young guardsman suddenly ran in and said clearly and firmly, "Your Majesty, the reds have risen in the north of the country!" Otto was surprised, but clearly not confused. After pondering what he had said, he replied, "It was to be expected. In our 'brave new world,' there is no other way. If you give power to the right, the left will rise, and vice versa. The world is changing. You can't change anything." \n\nThen he fell silent and stared out the window for a long time. The sun was just reaching its zenith. The greenery was pleasantly soothing to him. But in the distance he could see the dark clouds coming in. A storm was coming. "What are you going to do?" - The fighter asked, already out of breath. Otto looked out of the window a little longer, then turned around, sat down at the table and said with pain in his soul, "As fearless as the Austrians are, so stupid are they. Send out the army." The soldier, after hesitating a bit, waiting for another "most interesting" lecture, nodded his head and rushed to the phone. \n\nSoon Otto called his assistant and asked him to dial Gil. Otto, being a lover of accuracy, was going to paint a picture of what was happening in Austria. It might, of course, have caused anxiety in Berlin, but he knew for certain that the Austrians would listen to no one else. Thinking over his words again, he dialed the telephone. \n\n "Yes, Mr. Otto, Vladimir Gil is at the machine," said a clear voice.

Not only had the original plan to seize the territories of Westphalia and Baden failed and the local leaders miraculously escaped death, but the cursed Baader had also spoiled everything with his rebellion. \n\nWest Germany looked more and more like a patchwork quilt, ripping apart before our eyes. As he approached the city, Otto-Ernst heard the sounds of air defenses and the thundering explosions of exploding artillery shells, indicating that the Rhineland Alliance forces intended to go on the offensive in the region and push back the Werewolf forces. The Reich General could not allow this to happen. \n\nOnce there, Otto left the armored personnel carrier and saw the new army with his own eyes, unwashed, hungry, and with frantic eyes, the last of the Reich loyalists looked like this. The situation was depressing, and then the commander's mind began to flood with memories. Of the campaign of '41 and the fight against Russia, even though it initially seemed that the expanse of Russia would swallow the German war machine, he proved that the German spirit was invincible. And now he will prove it again. \n\nAs the commander-in-chief approached the headquarters, the thought suddenly flashed through his mind that the war he was now engaged in was only an echo of that war more than 30 years earlier. Every word was another bullet, every order a grenade. And at the head of it all stands the soldier Remer, the last Loyalist turned warrior, who stands and conducts the army like an orchestra, destroying everything..."

Left without orders from above, the garrison of the city opened fire on the rioting workers at night, which was a fatal mistake, and by seven o'clock the garrison was completely overwhelmed, the bodies of the executioner soldiers were hanging on the street poles, giving the whole place an atmosphere of a kind of madness. A revolutionary frenzy that did not abate for a minute. \n\nBy ten o'clock, a total pogrom of shops, banks, police stations began. All this became the target of popular anger. A little later, the arsenal fell to the onslaught of the crowd. And at the head of it all was Baader, who had personally arrived in town. \n\nAround lunchtime he stood on the square surrounded by ordinary people, tired of the oppression of the bourgeoisie, of the Nazis and Russians who had occupied these lands and later handed Germany over to loyal czars. Now was clearly not the moment for long and loud speeches, but Baader knew what to do. In a couple of jerks he climbed into the armored vehicle like another leader of the revolution half a century earlier and began to push his speech. "Comrades! To the workers of Austria and Germany. The time has come to throw off the shackles of imperialism, to wrest Germany from the hands of the bourgeoisie and foreign influence. Today the bourgeoisie has given us an unheard of gift! They gave us a machine gun! With which we're going to beat down the cities of those who are not ready to accept the revolution. And you are witnessing the birth of a new Germany, free, honest and strong! So let us comrades make the great leap toward communism and free the motherland from its clutches," when Baader finished he decided to take a better look at the crowd around him. \n\nThese were not ragamuffins, not expendable material to be burned in factories. There were people cheering, and shouting. They were ready to follow Baader anywhere, even to hell, just to make Germany great again. The only thing Baader was thinking about now after the inspection was unusual, however. He distanced himself from the crowd and from the noise and thought, "What will be the last sound I hear?

Still, sometimes wars are fought for no particular reason. \n\nAfter the war, he just wanted to be alone, but he couldn't.

Nevertheless, almost to the door he decided to sit on the chair, a couple of minutes will not do anything now. \n\nBut then the unexpected happened. A sharp knock on the door broke all the plans of the new Führer. On the other side stood a young soldier, looking slightly inappropriate: frantic eyes, disheveled, something was clearly wrong. "Rockets! The Russians have launched!" - no formality, no appeal, but even that was enough to make Otto's pupil dilate. His heart raced and it was as if a concert had begun, squeezing out what was left of reason in his head. \n\nIt would be very difficult to describe the events further. Remer jumped into the armored personnel carrier in a state of rage and made his way to the nearest bunker. His mind was jumbled with absolutely everything it could be. Plans were ruined and in general. Was there any point in hiding in the bunker?  \n\nevertheless, after half an hour of driving, the armored personnel carrier approached an inconspicuous hiding place somewhere in the German forests, a place for only one because of the size of the bunker and the amount of supplies there. The soldiers saluted Remer one last time as he closed the hatch behind him. He couldn't believe it, the work of his life was collapsing for the second time because of the damned Russians. When the general pulled himself together and decided to come out something shook the bunker as if a giant monster was walking through the woods from above. General Reich never found the strength to come out. \n\nAnd now he was alone in the bunker, the executioner of the German people, like Sisyphus, whose work had just been reduced to atoms. In the darkness, he was nevertheless able to light a candle on a small table and sit in a chair. Somewhere in his pocket he fumbled for a cross, there could be no better moment for it.
