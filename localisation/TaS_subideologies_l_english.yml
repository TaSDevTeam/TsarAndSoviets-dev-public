 despotism_mladorossi_autocracy_subtype_desc:0 "The ideology of the Mladorossi experienced unusual metamorphoses in the conditions of Russian anarchy. Constant instability, a lot of threats and a lot of extremists have led to the emergence of the so-called Mladorossi autocracy.\n\nThe system formulated by Tsar Sergei Belozersky seriously changed the original ideology. Much more power is now concentrated in the hands of the tsar himself, and the prime minister is only an adviser, and the indisputable truth is only the words of the tsar himself.\n\nAlso an integral part of the ideology is a much greater emphasis on militarization and the army. Perhaps these metamorphoses went against the opinion of the founder of the ideology. However, it doesn't make much difference now.  «Tsar and  Soviets!», this is the slogan that will sound in the new, strong and honest Russian Empire, and no one will be able to prevent it."

 authoritarian_democracy_mladorossi_idea_subtype_desc:0 "Mladorossism is a very unusual ideology. In the first half of the twentieth century, Alexander Kazem-Bek created his syncretic ideology. The new political system was truly something unusual, as it combined the ideas of fascism and communism.\n\nIn the end, a method of governing the state was created with an order-type party, the purpose of which is enlightenment and a tsar at the head who is not a representative of any party. Also, the basis of the system are non-party councils, which are a way of interacting with local and central government offices of the monarch.\n\nAfter all, the Mladorossi movement is an unusual ideology. Cult of personality and monarchy here are opposed to totalitarianism. And the idea of spiritual brotherhood and strict national discipline ensure the creative freedom of the individual. And even though the movement is heterogeneous and many representatives of the Mladorossi have their own ideas on how to transform the ideology, the slogan \"Tsar and  Soviets\" remains unchanged."

 fascism_mladosocialism_subtype_desc:0 "The monarchist bias of the Mladorossi, according to the Mladosocialists led by Vladimir Gil, are outdated and can give nothing but the troubles and sufferings of Russia. Mladorossi were not able to create the people's tsardom, about which they cherished their dreams so much, and they were defeated by the hands of Tsar Vladimir III. However, they all showed their inability and showed complete detachment from reality. There is nothing to say that monarchism is not outdated and even useful.\n\nAt the same time, Bukharin's socialism turned out to be even more harmful to Russia, and because of his softness towards national minorities and weak control over the regions, the USSR did not achieve any success in the economy and in creating the country's defense capability, which led to sad consequences in the face of a fragmented Russia with more than 50 parts. Socialism in its pure form is harmful, but its individual ideas will be useful for Russia.\n\nVladimir Gil is convinced that only the third way for Russia will be right for development, since the Motherland simply has no other options. Combining the fascist base and some details of socialist ideals, Gil created a new ideology: Mladosocialism, which completely abandons monarchism in favor of fascist and social development of Russia. Only a firm hand with maximum well-being for the united Russian people will allow them to withstand new challenges that may fall on Russia in the near future."
 socialist_social_monarchist_subtype:0 "Social monarchism"
 socialist_social_monarchist_subtype_desc:0 "Mladorossi ideology itself has many similarities with the Soviet principles of governing the country, with which the ideology tries to achieve the creation of a people's kingdom with a just, truly popular tsar. However, it is not uncommon for socialist ideas to strengthen, which ultimately leads us to the creation of a left-wing bias of social monarchism. Relying on a planned economy, people's councils, and a strong ideology, as it was in the Bukharin USSR, they are trying to create on this basis a monarchical type of government that relies solely on the people, as the Soviet leadership did in the old days.\n\nTsar Alexei II was elected by the people, and he, as the original socialist, proposed his concept of Mladorossi, which falls under the concept of “left social monarchism». His concept is very original, unlike the orthodox ideas of Alexander Kazem-bek, that's why the ideology of social monarchism with a left bias can live in an original way."
