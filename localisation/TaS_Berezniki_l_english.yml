 MAR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Being only a far eastern province of the Vyatka Tsar Vladimir III, Berezniki, headed by his governor Alexander Kazembek, is a very distinctive region not only in Western, but possibly in the rest of free Russia. In an effort to combine the best of of the tsarist and Soviet regimes, the ideology of Kazem-bek developed the Mladorosska idea, which harmoniously combines both regimes.Many have heard of "Mladorossism", but everyone tends to think that Berezniki is a dark horse of free Russia with their crazy ideas to cross two incompatible ideologies. \n\nKazem-bek and his people are in a subordinate state before Vladimir III, and even finding a common language on some issues, it is obvious that such a status will not be respected.Alexander has his own vision for the future of Russia, which goes against with the vision of Tsar Vladimir. Maybe you should reconsider your view of their hidden potential?"

 TaS_leader_name_Alexandr_Kazembek:0 "Alexander Kazembek"
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KAZEMBEK_DESC:0 "In 1917, many Russian nobles saw their dreams crushed in a single moment. Their belongings were taken away and their Motherland was stolen by the Bolshevik beasts, dooming them to a beggarly existence abroad. Suffering from longing for the Motherland, many emigrants and their children sought for a new ideology to follow instead of the failed reactionary ideals and many saw the future in the most consistent and radical anti-Communist ideology of the time - fascism. For Alexander Lvovich Kazembek, a son of a Russian noble of Azeri descent, the Russian model of Fascism was the only way forward to bridge the gap between the Tsar and the commoners and establish a Russian national power, based on class collaboration and Tsarist ideocracy. Kazembek and his fellow-minded peers united into the Union of Mladorossi, which, despite its eclecticism and youthful vigor, attracted many prominent Russian exiles.\n\nBut even Kazembek's admiration for Mussolini couldn't be nearly as controversial as his fascination - if not to say, sympathy - with the Soviet system. Recognizing the inherent rottenness of the Marxist ideology, he claimed that the Russian people digested the Bolshevik brutality and overcame it from the inside, with the Soviet government, for all its flaws, becoming a true representative of the national interests. Most expected was his stance against the Nazi invaders to the Soviet Union, although as his reputation among the emigrant circles faded and he had to leave for the United States, he could little to do to resist them.\n\nA faithful and loyal monarchist, Kazembek accompanied Emperor Vladimir III in his war against the WRRF, putting aside his reservations. After the war, he became the crown's representative in Berezniki, managing the daily affairs of the reclaimed Tsarist province and organizing the industrial work for the needs of the Empire. Despite his nominal allegiance to the Tsar, there is little doubt in his ambitions, as Kazembek has never abandoned his desire to see the triumph of people's monarchy."

 POLITICS_MIKLAY_KAZAKOV_DESC:0 "The Mari people had long been denied their nationhood by every Russian state and its successors who ruled over them. Whether they bore the red banner of socialism or the tricolor, it was all the same, but Miklay Ivanovich Kazakov made it his life's goal to change that. As the victory of the Anti-Communist Guard in West Russia became almost an inevitability, he rallied ethnic Mari across the region to join a Mari Regiment which fought alongside the Guard.\n\nLabelled the "warrior poet" by his compatriots, as he always kept a passion for poetry and literature, Kazakov was the obvious choice to be placed as the leader of the first ethnic Mari state and so he became.\n\nThe Republic has been another success story for North Russia, as Kazakov has stabilized it and looks to other states of the Idel-Ural as well as Arkhangelsk for cooperation and solidarity."

 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_DESC:0 "Mladorossi Russia has been cleansed of its dark past thanks to its virtues and determination to revive the nation from the ashes. We were able to do this thanks to the efforts of all those who are not indifferent to us. Among those was the current tsar Sergei Belozersky.\n\nThe tsar elected by the Zemsky Sobor deserves his nickname \"Tsar-General\", since he held military positions in Berezniki. Until recently, he held the post of Minister of the Armed Forces of Berezniki, and even earlier he served Nicholas II in the American army. He returned to his homeland to help his citizens regain their former greatness, and only the Young Russians can restore this greatness. \n\now that he is in power, Belozersky is aware of all his responsibility entrusted to him. The \"Tsar-General\" is an experienced manager and he perfectly understands how to rule the country. His firm grip and the warm heart of the Mladorossi will help in this matter. The whole country supports him, and he must meet the expectations of these people. There is still a lot of work to be done to establish order in Russia, and even more to unite the whole Homeland under a single flag. Belozersky should not put his ancestors to shame, and he will succeed and surpass them in this." 
 POLITICS_SERGEY_BELOZERSKI_70S_DESC:0 "Tsar-General Belozersky managed to unite all free Russia under his rule. As a distant descendant of the Rurikovichs, he was able to prove to everyone that he is the true heir to his great ancestors, and now no one will reproach him for being a liar and impostor All enemies were overthrown and thrown from the power of their own pseudo-states, no matter how.\n\nCombining the best of the present and the past regime, he deserved the title of a true Young Russian, the chosen king. The Russian people have risen and are ready to move on again, despite the terrible events of the past. And yet, in some places, he nevertheless lied - the power is still stronger with the king, and perhaps this is only for the better, because such great successes have been achieved. And perhaps the roots of strong power come from tsarist Russia, which perished more than half a century ago.\n\nStill, Belozersky doesn't plan to stop there. There is nothing that could now hold back the Russian people from righteous revenge for the defeat in the Great Patriotic War. The Russian people will liberate Moscow, and this is destined for us by fate itself, just as it was how Belozersky will emerge victorious from the battle for all of Russia. \n\nSome are worried, however, by the advanced age that is already making itself felt. There is no time for reflection, so Russia will prepare for a sacred campaign, as Minin and Pozharsky did. \n\n§RTo Moscow§!."

 POLITICS_VLADIMIR_GIL_DESC:0 "Vladimir Gil, despite all his obvious generalship talents, is a very mysterious figure with some kind of secret in his life. This secret is known only to him, and perhaps this is fortunate, since this secret is extremely gloomy for the ordinary man in the street. \n\nGil served in the Soviet Union successfully, by the beginning of the war he was already a lieutenant colonel. Few doubted his loyalty to the Motherland, but Gil clearly had a different opinion on this matter. He did not like the Bukharin regime, considered it too weak for the USSR to survive in the future. However, there were those circumstances that showed the obvious weakness of the regime. \n\n In the summer of 41, he was captured by German troops, and abruptly he became one of the collaborators of the German occupation. It is not known what exactly prompted this to be done: whether it was a cold calculation for survival, or sincere hatred for Bukharin, but anyway, he began to serve not just in the ranks of the army of Nazi Germany, but in the ranks of the SS, organizing the first Russian national SS brigade \"Druzhina\". Gil himself took the call sign \"Rodion\". Nevertheless, the Soviet leadership did not know that he had switched sides, at least he was listed as missing. \n\nevertheless, the service in the SS was relatively short. At first, he effectively destroyed partisan detachments, but later his squad stopped coping with their tasks, and besides, obvious suspicions crept in that he himself collaborated with the partisans. We obviously won't know this anymore, only Gil himself knows the whole truth. For this, the command sent Gil to the border of the \"A-A\" line, and perhaps already at this time he figured out how he would switch back to the side of the Reds. \n\nShortly before the start of the West Russian War, he and his detachment switched sides with the West Russian Revolutionary Front, specifically in the area where Tukhachesvky was. To all questions about what he was doing, he said that he was in captivity and was forced to cooperate. They believed him, and he was immediately assigned to manage a couple of divisions that were under the command of the Red Napoleon. Gil himself, in addition to this, also handed over many of his  former employees, from which during the war they especially searched for certain persons for a long time in order to punish them in full. Sometimes, by the hand of Gil himself. \n\nAfter another defeat from the Germans,Gil was finally disappointed in the red ideas of the realization that was presented in the person of Bukharinites, these Western Russian front-line soldiers, and others, who clearly referred to the weak power of the center and the strong power of local administrations. He found a glimmer of hope for the Russian people in the ideas of the Mladorossi, who were led by Kazem-bek, and eventually, 2 years after the end of the West Russian War, he secretly fled from the ranks of the Russian Communist Party and found himself in Berezniki."

That being said, there are no other obvious heirs to the Russian throne, providing Berezniki with no clear options for their future."
 MAR_oldfashion_army:0 "Old army"
 MAR_oldfashion_army_desc:0 "The Berezniki army is but a small shadow of Soviet power, meagre even by the poor standards of Tsarist times. Outdated weapons, tattered clothing and poor military doctrines plague the forces, badly limiting the combat readiness of the army. There are many officers and ordinary soldiers in the ranks who are themselves too backwards thinking to conceive of anything better."
 MAR_renewed_army:0 "Army of the \"new\" model"
 MAR_renewed_army_desc:0 "Finally, our army has rid itself of the ghosts of the past. The Soviet and Tsarist legacy expunged from men and our equipment, Berezniki is now organised along a new model that meets the challenges of our time. Our army is now equipped with modern machine guns, new uniforms and up-to-date tactics that will allow us to crush the enemies of our young state."

 ### National Focus ###
 MAR_kazembek_begining:0 "Start from scratch"
 MAR_kazembek_begining_desc:0 "The state of Berezniki is a small one, most of which is divided from Vyatka by the Kama river. Our state is formally subject to the Vyatkan Tsar, although this does not significantly reduce our nominal autonomy. Nevertheless, Vladimir’s military forces could conceivably take power in Berezniki by force, stamping out our governorate and erasing it from the history books. Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek has long doubted whether he did the right thing in deciding to support Vladimir III. Unfortunately, whilst you can’t undo the mistakes of the past, you can try to correct them in the present."
 MAR_package_vyatka:0 "Package"
 MAR_package_vyatka_desc:0 "Our warehouses are nothing but a laugh stock, with three soldiers forced to share a rifle among them. All we can do is sit still in our place and watch a German stooge play at being Tsar, every day inching closer to our stamping out our autonomy. This cannot stand!\מWe must seek payment from Vladimir for our continued vassalage."
 MAR_our_future:0 "Our future"
 MAR_our_future_desc:0 "The land is a vast expanse, bounded by the Urals in the east and the Kama river in the west. Small hills and forests stretch across a vast plain ruled by, over which the fragile government of the Young Russians rule. Our government consists of decrepit old people who have all but decomposed into mold and dust, unable to answer the great challenges of our time. The threat of the Nazis lingers in the south, whilst the growing influence of Vyatka permeates across our borders. Worse still, only a small Christian order separates us from the rampaging communists of the north."
 MAR_berezniki_prosperity:0 "Prosperity"
 MAR_berezniki_prosperity_desc:0 "Our young state needs a strong economy. At the moment, we do not have any heavy industry while, our agriculture and general standards of living are poor. This is further complicated by our dependence on the liars in Vyatka, who draw our resources for their greedy goals. We need to change this situation by realising our economic potential at full capacity, and Kazem-Bek understands this. The only question remains - how?"
 MAR_blood_and:0 "Blood and..."
 MAR_blood_and_desc:0 "Every miner in Berezniki should work for the good of our home. Of course, the mines are not rich in iron, coal and other necessary resources. But potassium and magnesium salts from our mines, which are used for fertilisation, will help us solve our agricultural issues and can also be exported to obtain the resources that we, the Young Russians, need. Therefore, Kazem-Bek will order the introduction of a 14 hour working day - a difficult decision, but a necessary one to save our homeland."
 MAR_sweat:0 "Then..."
 MAR_sweat_desc:0 "The same gruelling targets were applied to the peasants, who plowed the land and received a good harvest with the benefit of fertilisers. Their work was not easy. While many miners were dying of dehydration or cave-ins, spilling blood in the mines, the peasants suffered from fatigue, scouring their wearywearied hands to the bone. The burden was not light on the Mladorossi rural workers."
 MAR_we_need_it:0 "We need it more"
 MAR_we_need_it_desc:0 "The workers of Young Russia have toiled, but at what cost? Most of their labours were given to Vyatka, straight into the hands of Vladimir III. Since our efforts are now aimed at a domestic policy, namely the construction of the state, we ourselves need those resources, and thus we have no choice but to completely stop all supplyinglies of resources to Vyatka."
 MAR_narodnaya_lubov:0 "People’s Love"
 MAR_narodnaya_lubov_desc:0 "Due to a recent set of difficult decisions by Kazem-Bek’s government, the popularity of our administration has reached a nadir. We cannot allow this to continuethis continue - additional food rations shall be distributed to the population to raise morale. This will of course strain our economy, but it must be done for the sake of the people. Workers in the mines, peasants in the fields, teachers and professionals - all of them can be targeted every day by the Luftwaffe, and like many other people working for the good of the country, all of them remain mortal. We need to support them no matter the cost, especially considering the threat of strikes if we refuse to act."
 MAR_we_and_proletariat:0 "We and the proletariat"
 MAR_we_and_proletariat_desc:0 "After diplomatic discussions with Vyatka on the issue of resource transfers, we have succeeded in reducing our obligations. It’s now time to lighten the burden of workers in factories and mines, recognising the sacrifices that these people have made for our cause. By the decision of Kazem-Bek and the Bereznikov government, major concessions will be made to the workers, including the increase of food rations and the institution of a lunch breaks. Our growing agricultural output will more than compensate for this increase in food consumption."
 MAR_new_equipment:0 "New equipment"
 MAR_new_equipment_desc:0 "It’s high time to improve the working conditions of our proletariat, who deserve our help. We have received reports of trouble with our industrial equipment, most of which originates from Bukharin’s time and has received only basic maintenance since. We are of course aware that the industrialists in Zlatoust have far better equipment, and the government has quickly drawn up a plan. We do not care how much money must be spent - the priority must be to provide workers with the best machinery we can buy, and purchasing new machines from Zlatoust can only be a benefit to our homeland...."
 MAR_rabfactories:0 "Revival of the Rabfak"
 MAR_rabfactories_desc:0 "New machines and new tools mayight be the bedrock of modern industry, but in our haste to procure them we have forgotten a critical piece of the puzzle - the staggering scale of illiteracy amongst industrial labourers. All but a handful of our workers are completely unable to interpret the complex technical manuals and instructions that came with the equipment, and many machines lie idle with no technician brave enough to work out theirits operation on their own. Kazem-Bek, ever mindful to improve the condition of his people, has consulted with the education ministry and developed a plan to immediately improve worker literacy. We shall approach the issue with joint objectives, aiming to teach the labourerworker how to use the new equipment whilst also ensuring that he leaves work with reading and writing skills that are suited to everyday life. Workers’ faculties will be re-established at factories and worksites, providing education jointly to both children and adults in a manner suited to their specific industrial field."
 MAR_into_light_future:0 "Economic miracle"
 MAR_into_light_future_desc:0 "The reforms were not in vain! Despite the people who lost their lives in the early days of our industrial reforms, and how families were broken in the process, the sacrifices of the few have proven to be the salvation of the many. Our country is rising from its feet, and steadyingied itself against being knocked down again. Of course, the lives of ordinary workers will not be forgotten, and we will honour those who gave their lives for our ideals, for our future, for our army - setting our country on a path to greatness in an age where they shall be rightfully recognised as heroes."
 MAR_right_on_future:0 "Right for the Future"
 MAR_right_on_future_desc:0 "The future of our country liesis in its children, so it is problematic, to say the least, that most of our children are illiterate. Our government must build schools where children can study and where German bombs will not reach them."
 MAR_in_a_row_with_man:0 "Alongside a man"
 MAR_in_a_row_with_man_desc:0 "People may claim otherwise, but women have always been an important part of society, even during the Empire, when there were a few female as monarchs. Why should we consider them stupid or weak? Alexander Lvovich thinks as much, and has adopted a decree on the admission of women into the army, as well as allowing women into more difficult and dangerous industrial jobs."
 MAR_two_sides_of_the_coin:0 "Two sides of the same coin"
 MAR_two_sides_of_the_coin_desc:0 "Despite the visible successes of our country, our future remains as hazy as our soot -blackened sky. Kazem-Bek, who has always sought to establish a true people’s monarchy, does not yet know who could be deemed worthy of the throne. The issue must be resolved as soon as possible, lest his ideas come to nothing and the future of Russia becomes unclear again."
 MAR_beloozero:0 "At the White Lakes"
 MAR_beloozero_desc:0 " The Belozersky family is a dynasty nineteen generations removed from the Rurikids, and derives its name from the White Lakes of Finland and Russia, ever coated with a blanket of snow. Despite such an ancient history, many descendants of the family are still alive and thriving, although many more left Russia long ago. There is fortunately still one well-known person of this lineage in our ranks - Sergei Sergeevich Belozersky, a general of the Mladarossi, and an influential man. Whilst he is probably the best representative of the Belozerskys in our reach, he has no heir, and thus we must carefully reflect on the wisdom of supporting his candidacy."
 MAR_the_tsar_daughter:0 "Beyond the Kami"
 MAR_the_tsar_daughter_desc:0 "Kazem-Bek, despite his disdain for Vladimir’s rule in nearby Vyatka, cannot deny that his daughter Maria Romanova constitutes a viable and untainted replacement for him as a ruling Tsarina. Despite the unfortunate events of 1917, the Romanovs still remained strong and legitimate contenders for control of a united Russia. Despite Vladimir’s unworthiness, Maria is young and pliable enough to become a true people’s queen, ruling with the consent and adoration of her subjects."
 MAR_weird_news:0 "Strange news"
 MAR_weird_news_desc:0 "Kazem-Bek loved to read newspapers, and far more than just the local publications. Whilst there was seldom much else to do with his spare time, he still took great pleasure in reading about events across far flung parts of Russia. He had several friends in various countries around Russia who would regularly send him parcels of newspapers, and with them he was able to monitor recent events with surprising efficiency. As he opened a newspaper sent very recently from the Komi Republic, he looked on in surprise at the article set out before him."
 MAR_slezhka:0 "Spying on Vladimir's Pawns"
 MAR_slezhka_desc:0 "Almost the entire apparatus of power in the region, much of which stands in opposition to our goals, has recognised that Berezniki has charted a course away from the interests of Vladimir’s clique. We are already preparing to march against Vyatka, but there are a huge number of people who will be loyal to Vladimir III rather than to Kazem-Bek. Moreover, there are frankly far too many people from Vyatka who are too ignorant of our objectives to understand our righteous cause. They are told the Mladarossi are insane, doomed to be a footnote in history! We would be wise to keep track of such elements, or we will face a crushing defeat in the war to come."

 berez_eco.1.d:0 "Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek has long doubted whether he did the right thing in deciding to support Vladimir III. Unfortunately, whilst you can’t undo the mistakes of the past, you can try to correct them in the present. \n\nFor several decades, Kazem-Bek has been the head of the Young Russia party - the Mladrossi. In all that time, his goal of bringing happiness to the people has eluded him, and instead he finds himself huddling in a small town, forever fearing the Nazi planes overhead. \n\n“How did I end up here?” - Alexander constantly asked himself. He knew in his heart that he himself was to blame for the misadventures he had endured under the leadership of Vladimir III. The so-called Tsar was a greedy, petty and cynical man who wanted little more than to return to the heritage of his ancestors and inflict death and pain on our people. When it became clear that they had gained the upper hand, they easily got rid of both Vladimir and Alexander, respectively. Now Kazem-Bek rots in Berezniki, trying to find a way out of his predicament. After much reflection, Alexander realised that there was only one way out - to cast the false Tsar down from his throne and find someone who can really be trusted and who can become a true People’s King. It is time to prepare the ground for the emergence of a new Tsarist Russia."

He led his soldiers out with flashlights and beckoned the drivers onto a layby beside the road. Such exchanges could be carried out at night - and only at night - for no one knows when the Germans might be watching from overhead. \n\nA witness to the scene might question the need for such a gathering, but the answer was quite simple. The Young Russians exchanged useful resources for equipment and uniforms for their soldiers, having little industry in Berezniki to produce their own. In a matter of hours, goods from both sides were exchanged, and thereafter the two peoples - so similar yet so different - parted again into the enveloping twilight."

The dire condition of what could barely be called an army took the highest priority of all. Yet the practically non-existent support of the masses also posed a grave concern. Unfortunately, our prior actions hadve caused the people to view us wrongly as German accomplices. \n\nThe last thing we must do is finding a new King to replace the wretched Vladimir III and his minions. If no such candidate is forthcoming, we must search for a suitable one. It shall take careful preparation, but the devil himself shall not stop us from achieving greatness for Russia."

 berez_eco.4.d:0 "Kazem-Bek, the leader of Berezniki, listened attentively to the regular monthly reports of his ministers about the economic situation. The overall economic picture frankly did not please him, and the overall prognosis was depressing. The time for genuine action had some. Efficiencies would have to be found or the economy would continue to spiral into complete collapse. \n\nKazem-Bek convened a small commission, which included all the prominent managers and entrepreneurs in Berezniki. He set a number of goals for economic development, stressing the need for haste. With the country being so small, the committee agreed that real change could be achieved in just a month. Economists and businesspeople bickered amongst themselves, and as the days and weeks passed by more recommendations were made to the state.\n\nBy the end of a gruelling few weeks, the experts among the committee brought forward their recommendations. It would be necessary to carefully reprioritise production, directing them to primary industry - mining and agriculture. The first would be used to extract iron and potassium-magnesium salts for use as fertiliser, whilst agriculture would serve to alleviate malnutrition and hunger and raise morale. They argued that Berezniki should take into account the experience of Bukharin’s state and learn lessons from its failures to create a stable economic model before implementing any further plans. \n\nKazem-Bek largely agreed with the decision of the economists, but he stressed the need to avoid a strictly Marxist model, so some ideas were reworked to avoid this possibility. It was clear from the plan that such economic development would be difficult for the people, but that the sacrifices they made wouldwill be necessary for their own well-being."

Today Kazem-Bek introduced a decree in which he announced a course for the development of new mines and the expansion of existing ones to extract more resources. A new slogan was introduced - “More salt - more food!” To get more salt, of course, the people needed to work harder, and thus the 14 hour work day came into effect for every miner.\n\nWith the introduction of the 14 hour working day, significant progress has been made. Firstly the volume of extraction from the existing mines of all kinds of ores and salts hasve almost doubled. The profitability of these enterprises has increased by the same amount, and now Berezniki can provide themselves with much-needed salts and metals that can be exported to purchase other products. \n\nYet at the same mine, many other issues arose. Many miners were dissatisfied with the almost twofold increase in the working day. In addition, many workers have already suffered, having received wounds due to neglect of labour protection, experiencedreceived chronic fatigue, and in general were negatively affected bysuffered from immense overwork, with some even dying from exhaustion. The workers now joke that the salts will taste like blood, but that cannot be helped...\n\nThere is no need to stop - the work must continue."

In today’s decree Kazem-Bek increased the working day for peasants, and furthermore recommended new varieties of fertilisers to speed up crop growth. \n\nThe fact that bureaucrats from above were ordering longer working hours in the fields caused great fury among some peasants, because Russian peasants traditionally worked according to their own hours and their own schedule, knowing from experience what to do and when to do it. Despite this, many were pleased that new fertilisers were being made available, which would make it far easier to meet their production targets and produce better grain."

In fact, there seemed to be no reaction on their part whatsoever. No inspections, no armed men, no personal letters from Vladimir or indeed anything else turned up. It was as if they had completely forgotten about the existence of Berezniki.\n\nKazem-Bek, who had never felt much loyalty to Vladimir from the outset, decided that in the absence of a reaction it was safe to stop supplying resources to Vyatka completely. The orders were sent out to the supply depots the next day. Until Vyatka notices what has happened, we can now use all the resources that are extracted from the depths of our country’s soil for our own benefit."

Is it really that hard to make lifet a little better?” He cursed Kazem-Bek, the bloodsucking Azeri. He didn’t enjoy his work at all, but this was the only way to survive another day.\n\nAnother working day passed. At the end of it, Mikhail had neither the strength nor the desire to do anything. Only a coughing and a chest pain to show for it. A strange man in uniform stopped him at the exit.\n\n“Comrade Bykov, I presume?” the man asked.\n\n“Yes, what do you want?” answered the miner.\n\n“This is for you,” replied the stranger, reaching for something. \n\nThe miner spontaneously broke out in sweats, his heart beating rapidly in his chest.\n\n“This is a package for you,” explained the man, “it contains additional food and medicine for your family.

As expected, the convoy of cars moved towards Zlatoust, proving a tempting target for the robbers and bandits of nearby towns and villages. The convoy en route to Zlatoust no doubt had little of true value within, but on its return it would undoubtedlyno doubt be filled with all manner of provisions, industrial machines, weapons and supplies that would interest even the most cautious of robbers. \n\nYet, the caravan from Berezniki was prepared for all kinds of bandits - or almost prepared. Having entered the territory of Zlatoust, the caravan was stopped by a patrol and interrogated about the purpose of  the visit., After declaringhaving learned about their desire to exchange resources for machines, the caravan was allowed through on the condition that the guards remained on the border. FollowingAfter several more hours of driving, they reached the city of Zlatoust itself, and negotiations were organised with a local businessman.\n\n“So you propose to exchange ore, food and some foreign currency for equipment and factories. Hmm, if I am to believe this documentation that you’ve given me, then this will be enough to exchange for machines, tools and technical drawings.

 berez_eco.16.d:0 "The workers' facultyworkers faculty, a tried-and-tested system from the Soviet days, was smoothly set up in Berezniki, having a remarkable impact on the literacy of the workers from the outset. That came as no surprise - because often the fresh and successful ideas of today are in fact the long forgotten wisdom from times past. The decision to open workers faculties was discussed favourably by the Minister of Economy Nina Krovosheina and Kazem-Bek at a cabinet meeting.\n\n“We were able to begin our exchanges with Zlatoust and import much needed equipment, but we continue to be faced with an acute issue of poor worker knowledge. Eliminating machine breakdowns is proving impossible, given the amount of improper usage the machines are being put through for weeks on end. Nina Krovosheina, please tell us what you had in mind,.” Kazem-Bek gestured across from him.\n\n“Thank you gentlemen. I present to you ‘“Rabfaki’”. Organisations that train people in skills for enterprise and industry. At first they will have to teach our workers how to operate their machines, but in time their remit should grow much larger.”\n\nSergei Obolensky raised his hand to interject, “Your plan is certainly ambitious, and surely badly needed, but where do you propose to find the people to train our workers? If we had some, they would be on the factory floor already, but they aren’t. In fact, most of our resources were spent buying these machines, and I struggle to see how we can source any qualified teachers with the finances so finely stretched. And of course, the question then arises...”\n\nKrovosheina waved a sheet of paper in front of her in annoyance. “Sergei, please let me finish my presentation before you pass judgement. If you still have objections once I finish, you can express them then. Yes, undoubtedly we do not have qualified teachers, at least ones skilled with industrial machinery, and finding volunteers to teach barely literate labourers in one of the most dangerous regions in Russia is a difficult task. That being said, we can request support from Vladimir, in exchange for those same resources, and thus entice qualified personnel to come to us. It would unfortunately require us to postpone the exchange of resources with Zlatoust, but the equipment is in any case useless without people to operate it. Surely you understand that?”\n\nThere was silence in the office, and everyone except Nina and Kazem-Bek was thinking about prospects and opportunities that lay ahead. The workers did not really have much experience with the equipment, but to stop deliveries, even for a couple of weeks, could derail the entire process of industrial modernisation.\n\n“To hell with your cynicism, Sergei,” explained Obolensky, “as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained. We can last a little while longer without new machines - our past experience proves that we can manage without.”"

Ordinary party members were inclined to agree - as indeed were the ordinary people who were tired of being slaves. He did not hide his own fascist views, but he was quick to emphasise his adherence to fascism on clearly Russian lines. Russian fascism was the only salvation, as far as he was concerned. Power based on class co-operation couldan be the only sustainable bedrock for a new Tsarist meritocracy.\n\nThere was a problem of course - he could not become the monarch - for although he was a  nobleman, he was of Azerbaijani origin, quite unsuited to rule over the Russian rodina. It was therefore necessary to appoint someone who had a more credible claim to the throne. He could, of course, have turned to Vladimir III, but there could be no doubt that he would in time repeat the mistakes of Nicholas II and plunge the country back into anarchy, once again in the clutches of both the Bolsheviks and Nazis alike. Worse, Vladimir had been a friend to the Germans in times past, and for the simple sake of power he had turned against the very Russians who now claimed to rule. Russia surely deserved better!\n\nExamining all the options before him, Kazem-Bek concluded that he had only two legitimate and capable candidates for the Russian throne. They were Maria Romanova, a daughter of Vladimir, and Sergei Belozersky, the verydistant, distant male line descendant of Rurik, 19 generations removed. The first candidate was very young, only 9 years old, but with the right approach, education and upbringing, she could be equipped to govern the state wisely and independently. The second is an experienced military man and a member of the Young Russians, who was of course in a far better position to govern. Yet his weak connection to the imperial family put a spoke in his wheels.\n\nBoth options hadve their merits, but in the end only one couldan be entrusted with rulership.

The genus to which he belongs is connected to the Rurikids 19 generations ago. In 1911 he entered His Imperial Majesty’s Corps of Pages, from which he graduated in 1914 with a promotion to the rank of cornet of the Life Guards Cavalry Regiment. A participant in World War I, he rose to the rank of staff captain, commanding the second division of the aforementioned regiment. \n\nAfter the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, he entered the North-Western Army of General Yudenich, in which he served as the chief of staff of the II Corps. After the defeat of the White Movement in the North-West, he left through Finland to Great Britain, where he served in steamship companies, and later moved to France.

The name of the Romanovs is still associated with strong power, and in the turmoil of the revolution there were still many who rallied to their side, despite the repressions fromof the Bolsheviks. Maria Romanova is already a capable girl, speaking two foreign languages (English and French), well versed in ethics, history and a master of horse riding. We can surely conclude that she would be a good heiress. Despite this, there are two significant problems - she still does not know how to govern a state, and moreover, she is only nine years old. \n\nIn the view of Kazem-Bek, Vladimir is not just incapable, but rather a traitor who befriended the Germans in the vain pursuit of power, and thus unable to ever bridge the divide between his rule and the lives of the people. His actions during the West Russian War were little different to that of the other perfidious collaborators, such as the turncoat Vlasov and his detestable KONR. Kazem-Bek dreams that the ruler of Russia will be close to the Russian people and mindful that his power is checked by their admiration and respect - or lack of it. Such a dream can only be realised by Maria Romanova, who can still be taught the ideals of a People’s Monarch. \n\nMaria, under the strict and vigilant supervision of Kazem-Bek, must understand that it is necessary to be closer to the people, and therefore he will make every effort to make sure thatso that she follows the path set by the ideology of the Mladarossi.

He carefully studied each page, making sure not to miss any pertinent information that might have escaped anthe untrained eye. His office was filled with cuttings and excerpts from various newspapers, highlighting significant moments in recent Russian history. The situation in Komi particularly held his interest, with countless factions fighting for dominance across their dysfunctional and multi-faceted political system.n\nHe read through pages of mundane and repetitive news before he stumbled across an article quite unlike anything he had read before. The article, written about the liberal leader Alexei Kosygin, claimed that he was none other than the miraculously surviving Alexei Romanov, the son of Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nElaborating on this account, the article went on to explain that on the day of the Royal Family’s planned execution by the Bolsheviks, they were able to flee captivity and evade detection by unknown means. It went on to claim that the former Tsar took monastic vows, whilst his wife fled to Gatchina. Although short on specifics, it claimed that one of his daughters then became a nun, another fled to Uzbekistan, and a third found refuge infled to Finland. As for Alexei himself, it would seem that he found himself under the tutelage of Bukharin, perhaps because the Soviet leader felt having taken pity foron the boy, and was given a new identity - the son of a lowly craftsman, and was eventually able to pursue a career in the party under the assumed family name “Kosygin”. \n\nThe article pointed to real similarities in appearance and significant similarities in character - both men were not inclined to indulge in anydo not feel any craving for excesses, and both displayed a great intellect. There wasis some evidence that Alexei Romanov said that he would like to have more involvement in economics than in politics in general. Despite the very serious arguments in favour of this theory, there was of course a lot of evidence to the contrary. Kazem-Bek knew all too well that Tsarevich Alexei suffered from serious health problems, such that it would have been very difficult to imagine him living to his 60th birthday or beyond that. On top of that, there remained ample evidence that the royal family was indeed killed as the Bolsheviks had claimed. \n\nEven if Kosygin is not really the Tsarevich miraculously returned, it is still worth remembering this story. If he really is Alexei, then he will surely be another candidate for the throne of Russia. Perhaps he will become the Tsar!"

Yet even amongst the ranks of our government, which consists entirely of local residents, there are those who are more loyal to Vladimir than they are to the Mladarossi cause. This is unacceptable! These traitors could very easily become a fifth column in the event of a Vyatkan intervention, uniting with soldiers and citizens from afar to arrange a coup at the most opportune moment. There is only one tool at our disposal to resolve this situation, and although it might not flush out the traitors overnight, it will at least put the fear of God back into their hearts.\n\nKazem-Bek decided to create a new intelligence bureau, which would be tasked with internal counterintelligence, spying on those suspected of disloyalty to Berezniki and arranging for their swift deportation. They would operate as imperceptibly as possible, leaving few to notice that there was suddenly one less person in Berezniki. The deportations can of course be to any place in Russia - so long as it's not here!"

However, despite the obvious disadvantages of his rule, we must concede that he has offered us a great deal of protection against the external enemies who have long coveted our lands. Moreover, we assume that our enemies will take the chance to destroy Berezniki as soon as the opportunity presents itself.\n\nThe most dangerous enemy in this case is the Aryan Brotherhood. Their ambitions to create a racially defined “Aryan” territory are harmful to us, and yet only God above knows whether they shall succeed or fail. It is no longer a secret that they are actively preparing to wage war against us, and we could easily awake tomorrow to see their fighting detachments moving in on us to destroy our country and molest our people. Naturally, we must be prepared for when that time finally comes.\n\nOur military strategy concerningin relations to the Aryan Brotherhood boils down to containing it at the border, and then following up with a counterattack on Perm. We simply have nowhere to retreat, and therefore we must create good fortifications along the main avenues of attack along our border to ensure that they do not gain any significant territory before their advance is stalled.\n\nThere is hardly a lot of time left to create a system of fully-fledged bunkers. We can at least create positions sufficient to repel the very first attacks. We must do this with urgency, and to these efforts we must conscript every idle man and woman to do their duty, as things should be.\n\nFor a month, our women and elderly people worked in the earthworks, creating good strongholds for our soldiers to contain a potential enemy. They, with their sweat and their blood, built the foundations of victory for our people. By the end of the month, all the work was ready, and now our homeland is more secure than before."

This is done for that nobody can’t bug this dialog even in 5-10 meters from the office.\nKazem-bek and Sergey Beloozersky sit at the same table, there is only one astray.

I think our victory in this question guaranteed.\n\n- Do you have any ideas about our country’s future?\n\n- None, Alexander. But you think that after liberation we need to start realizing main Mladorossi plan, exactly creating people’s monarchy.\n\n- You are right, Sergey. As you know, our problem consists that we basically don’t have submitted monarch, which can realize our thing. I in principle can’t became a monarch. I’m honest here at least with myself. I’m Russian but with Azerbaijani origins, and people to all other don’t accept me as a monarch.\n\n- Sergey, interrupted – But who will become a monarch? I’m pity don’t know variants.\n\n- I’m talking about that you will become a monarch. Exactly you, man, connected with Rurikovichi in 19th generation, can become monarch. And from that, become you monarch or not depends you answer.\n\nSergey, calming from heard a dozen seconds before, says: “I won’t be against from Tsar’s crown if people decide this is necessary. I ready to take this burden only by people will. But if people choose another candidate, so I won’t intrigue against him.\n\n- I think this question will solved quietly. Don't worry, everything will be at its best.\n\nAfter this part Kazem-Bek and Sergey 15-20 minutes regulate questions, related to country’s future. After that time, discussion ends."

There are former White Guards and former Soviet political instructors in Berezniki. The first came to Berezniki along with the Mladrossi movement, whilst the Soviets were abandoned and forgotten after the war. Whatever one may say, these people know a lot about agitation and propaganda, and therefore we must use them to restore morale in the ranks.\n\nHaving found a number of serving officers who were previously either White Guards or political instructors, we will utilise them as part of a separate commissar structure to motivate the soldiers and raise their morale. The Commissar must remind the entire rank and file of the future we are fighting for. After that, he must inspire the soldiers to go on the attack or conduct desperate defense against our external enemies.

Of course, that was understandable, since Pavel worked in an important position, and probably received hundreds of letters a day.\nSergei strolled about his headquarters, lighting another cigarette to warm his bones in the chill of the night, directing his gaze out of the window. Belozersky let his mind wander, recalling his service in the US Army with his longtime friend, who still remained there in that distant land. \nA knock on the door startled him, and a private peeked his head into the room. He spoke of strange men in unknown uniforms wandering the streets, bearing no markings of any faction nearby. According to the private, they claimed to be in Berezniki on the orders of Pavel Dmitrievich, a peculiar claim to say the least. \nSergei immediately barked orders at the private, demanding that the men be brought to headquarters. An hour passed before a convoy of trucks pulled back into the compound. A man with US Army insignia emerged first. His name was Arnold Davis - lieutenant - the senior officer present and the leader of these troops. Arnold and Sergei struck up a conversation in broken Russian. \n\n- “Hello, comrades from Russia! I'm the Lieutenant Arnold Davis, a commander of those boys!”\n\n- “Hello” replied Sergei, as he reached out to shake his hand. Arnold responded in kind, stretching out his own in response, and took Sergei’s hand with a firm grip. \n\n- “How did you get here?” Sergei asked. \n\n- “With some hardness, and we come long way to be here.

We considered approaching the death merchants of Zlatoust, but we simply do not have the funds to pay. One could of course take weapons from smugglers from Germany, but the dangers of such an approach are too great. Our only option is to once more turn to the United States and its allies.\n\nIt was surprisingly easy to convince the United States to approve a project to deliver such a deadly cargo, with their agents disguising the shipment as a Red Cross convoy so that no suspicions would be raised. A month later, the first convoys arrived with provisions and the much needed weapons. A lot of modern weapons, which will allow us to at least slightly improve our army. The list is quite impressive, considering how much trouble it took to get them here. The ruse hasd paid off. \n\nMovers began to unload the convoys, and when the last box was delivered to the warehouse, the trucks drove away. Sergei and several soldiers approached one of the boxes, and he gave the command to open it. It was impossible to tell what Sergei was thinking when he looked upon the guns within, but he was certainly glad of what he saw. Before his eyes were weapons considered out of date by the Americans, but highly advanced by Russian standards. Grenades, rifles and their cartridges were piled up in each box - along with everything else that an infantryman could ask for. The weapons were distributed to those units that did not have a rifle for every man, and the surplus was sent to the warehouses."

A week later, Sergei instructed Arnold about the need to train the squad with all the techniques needed by a special forces unit, putting them through exhausting training, and ensuring their grasp of theory and stamina in battle. Belozersky noted that all these people were candidates for the Russian Special Forces, personally selected by Sergei, and gave Davis the discretion to exclude or suspend any candidate he deemed unfit from the unit. Creating a truly competent unit was the utmost priority. \n\nA few weeks later, only 59 people remained from the original group of one hundred100 candidates, with the rest excluded from the programme due to poor performance. The remainder would definitely end up in the first detachment of Special Forces, and have proven their worth by performing a range of tasks beyond the ability of regular soldiers.

Though their work was inefficient, the constant threat of German bombs made it unwise to build rifle factories on a larger scale. \n\nDuring his walk, he strolledwalked past a house in which a mother and a couple of her children were sitting. The woman narrowed her eyes at him as he went by, her eyes piercing Kazem-Bek as though she sought to silently communicate her hostility. Kazem-Bek perfectly understood why he was hated. As he left the woman’s sight, he asked himself whether he should have acted differently. Was it his duty to win the affection of the people? Despite the fact that he knew his duty and the country came before the prejudices of any singleone person, he often regretted the bitter stares and hushed whispers he provoked from the people who he sought to serve. \n\nWith the sounds of sirens and bombs no doubt only minutes away, Kazem-Bek returned to his residence to seek shelter and assess the day’s set of industrial reports. From out of his window he could see the city, twisted and warped by decades of Germanif German aggression, its people still not fully prepared to support its leader’s vision. It did not matter.

The guards say that neither the “Aryans” nor the bombers will prevent us from living this beautiful day! - said his friend Kolya.\n\n-I really want to believe...\n\n Reaching the field and taking the scythes, they began to harvest together. And the ears of corn obediently stand, do not move, humbly watching how they are cut. Everything is as usual... Anton plunged into his thoughts, thinking about his children, about his wife, about a hearty lunch and about ... a normal life for them. So that they would not be slaves like they are now.

They ran to Permkhayam to cry to their Fuhrer! And they recaptured this land! As it turned out later, we killed 25 people and lost 5. But you know, it's much easier to kill 25 people who attacked your village than to lose 5 people with whom you fought shoulder to shoulder.

But the war came, the Germans entered Moscow, and the shooting of Russians began. What he saw caused him psychological trauma. We will not go into this. His parents died, all his friends died too.

We live only on donations. Do you think I'm blinded if I don't want to notice it? But I can't take money for the grief of the dead people who are being killed by German bombers.

Although they were not given the opportunity to climb the mountain, they climbed it in an hour. It was a good result for \"beginners\". Soon they saw the plane itself. They were lucky that he was a couple of hundred meters away from them. They enthusiastically ran to him, but when they reached him, they were horrified. People were dismembered: heads, hands, guts... One of the crew threw up. One exclaimed:\n\n-They certainly deserve to die...but not like this!\n\n\"Who dismembered them? Who killed the entire crew before the explosion? Will we find out or not?\" - Grigory asked himself. They returned to headquarters before dark, taking photos and collecting various samples from the crash site. Grigory poured his cold coffee into the sink. \"After this, I definitely won't want to drink it!\"\n\n Some time after all this, the investigation decided that it was a malfunction in the engine, and because of a strong explosion, all the crew people were turned almost into ashes. Grigory and his team protested against this decision. They themselves saw a “very neat dismemberment”, and also the question remained: why did they not drop bombs, as usual? The investigation was silent. Everyone was silent. Probably this case will remain a secret forever."

It will consist of three priorities that we must continue to attend to - economic wellbeing, political consolidation and military strength. Each of these three points are very important to us - without the economy, we will not be able to sustain a protracted war, without political stability the shattering of West Russia may repeat itself, and without the army we will face defeat on the field of battle.

As it turned out, among the entire population of Berezniki there were about 5000 young men who were ready to join the army. They did so for various reasons - some have no choice but to join, being orphans or homeless, whereas others fought for their ideology, striving to defend their beautiful homeland and give thanks for the food, shelter and warmth it had provided him. These 5000 youths received basic military training in one week and are now fit for service in the army reserve.\n\nIn addition, Belozersky conducted parallel military exercises, involving almost the entire active army. The purpose of these exercises was to prepare the troops for offensive, mobile combat outside the current borders, and the exercises revealed many concerning yet entirely fixable problems amongst the troops whilst also drawing attention to numerous very positive qualities such as discipline and innovative use of equipment.

Do not forget such risks, and ensure that additional supplies of weapons are deposited a sufficient distance from the defensive line to ensure they are not lost to enemy incursions. These are Kazem-Bek’s direct orders. \n\nEarly in the morning, Belozersky and his small detachment went to one of the stockpiles, which had been preserved since the times of the West Russian War. In anticipation of combat nearby, they stockpiled weapons a significant distance from the main cache, which had already been packed to capacity.\n\nHaving opened the warehouse, it was immediately clear that no one had come here for a long time, perhaps not since the West Russian War itself. One could clearly feel the smell of “old days”, an aroma that lingered all through the air.

This wasn’t even the sole warehouse to search - according to credible records, five more remained untouched around Berezniki. \n\nHaving plundered the so-called “tactical wealth” of a decade prior, the army had equipped itself with more submachine guns, various pieces of support gear, as well as numerous cars and artillery pieces.

Various slogans have been tried on them to varying effect. “Let’s stop the Aryan bastards!” and “Let’s overthrow the false King!” refer to known enemies nearby, whereas “Forward for the Motherland!” and “Stop the chaos of the militant generals!” anticipate conflict on a larger scale.

The plan was fulfilled, and now the army was strong, the party united, and the economy well-prepared to supply weapons and munitions. In addition, the original plan of defence against the Aryan Brotherhood appeared to be very well considered, and was in no need of any further change. \n\nBelozersky strode into the hall where Kazem-Bek was sitting, his uniform still scruffy from his inspections along the line. Belozersky understood affairs better than Kazem-Bek, a fact that his leader could not easily deny. Skipping the formalities, Belozersky set out his findings in detail, expressing alarm about the current readiness for war with the Aryan Brotherhood. He noted the experience of the Maginot Line, a laughably useless military fortification built by the French to prevent Germany invasion which was quickly bypassed and rendered irrelevant by an unexpected attack from its north. The line of Berezniki could only be expected to hold up against an Aryan advance if they decided to attack directly - which cannot be taken for granted against any enemy. \n\nKazem-Bek listened carefully to Belozersky’s words, before asking; “What can be done to prepare ourselves further against an unexpected Aryan battleplan?”\n\nBelozersky replied, “We need to change the military strategy completely. I propose to develop it from scratch, and I will do so myself to ensure it is ready as soon as possible.\n\nKazem-Bek begrudgingly agreed. \n\nBelozersky, having gone to his office, summoned the most senior generals and division commanders to his office. After clarifying the present situation regarding military strategy, namely the proposal for an entrenched defence followed by a counterattack, he put forward his concerns once more and ordered the high ranking generals to develop a plan that could provide sufficient flexibility to defend against a flanking maneuver by the Aryans. He granted the staff freedom of imagination to come up with whatever plan they deemed appropriate, but reminded the generals of the urgency of the situation and ordered that a written plan must be provided by the end of the week. \n\nA week passed, and in that time the generals made three versions of the plan. \n\nThe first version of the plan focused not on defense, but on a preemptive strike with a sharp and deep penetration into the rear of the enemy’s territory. Our army would have to deliver such a strike long before the enemy dares to advance his own line of battle towards our then undermanned defensive positions. This strategy is strikingly different to the pre-war one.\n\nThe second version of the plan appeared to be a redesigned version of the old plan of operations. The strategy calls for a more limited pre-emptive strike, followed by subsequent consolidation of positions in the occupied territory to encircle the enemy position and deprive them of resupply. It is assumed that the enemy would react to this situation by attacking our outstretched line in an uncoordinated manner, depriving them of critical manpower and war materials. In this case, our army reserve would man the original defensive line, which should provide sufficient cover to less experienced soldiers. By assuming a defensive stance around the enemy we would be able to fortify further and launch our counterattack once our enemy is completely exhausted.\n\nThe third version of the plan, in short, is a consolidation of the previous two. This plan suggests that the first stage of the conflict should involve a quick strike to encircle the enemy forces, a period of entrenchment, and then finally a rapid advance on the capital of the enemy to secure the city before it can receive reinforcements. Gradual and well-organised attacks and prepared defences could completely prevent the movement of enemy forces and could in theory secure Aryan capitulation without engaging in a costly war of attrition. \n\nBelozersky considered the choices carefully, before making up his mind:"

And suddenly Andrey got a call:\n\n- Yes?\n\n- Andrey, this is Solzhenitsyn. Today is an important day. Kazem-Bek loyalists have shown their heads, so now it's time to chop them off. You go to the building of the MSS, where loyalists with weapons are now located. There shouldn't be so many of them, so your special squad should be able to handle it. The order must be executed immediately. Everything should go like clockwork. End of communication.\n\nAndrey hung up the phone and gathered his fighters. There were about forty people in their special squad. They should be enough to just enter and take the building. There should be no resistance. Andrey and his squad climbed into the truck that took the squad to the building.\n\nThe building of the MSS, where Kazem-Bek's betrayal to the Emperor was planned, was in good condition. It was very quiet outside. Not a single soul. Only the wind interrupted this damned silence a little. The MSS building had seven floors. It was distinguished only by the huge letters \"MSS\", which can be seen everywhere in Berezniki. \n\nThe squad moved forward to the entrance very slowly. Everyone was ready, weapons were loaded, and the eyes of the soldiers were directed at the windows. However, this tense situation was interrupted by one of the soldiers:\n\n- You know, maybe there aren't here after all? Why do we have to walk so slowly? – said one of the soldiers, but after a couple of seconds sniper's bullet killed him. Everyone fixed their eyes on the seventh floor, and noticed the sniper. Everyone started randomly shooting at him, but he only quickly took cover. While they were distracted by the sniper, the machine gunners immediately got out and started shooting from above. The effect of surprise, the presence of shelters, as well as the presence of height predetermined the outcome of the battle. Andrei shouted a retreat, everyone ran to the truck, but many fell from a bullet. Only five people were able to reach the \"safe point\", and the driver quickly stepped on the gas. Everything would have been fine for Andrei and for the rest of the soldiers, if not for a stray sniper bullet that hit right into the truck tire. Everyone noticed it at a sharp turn when the car overturned.\n\nAndrey was one of the survivors, he was badly injured, but he was picked up by medics. However, he was no longer able to fight.

Although he had to give 80% of the entire profit of the pub, but the remaining 20% was enough for the wages of workers, for the purchase of alcohol and tobacco, and for his personal needs. The pub is not really a business for him, but a place for conversations. There you could talk to everyone, and they would hear you, understand and help. Everyone came here not for a drink, but for a conversation, even though drinking was a so-called \"good addition” to conversations.\n\nThere was a radio in the pub, which mostly broadcast various songs, but after Solzhenitsyn's coup, where not to switch: propaganda is everywhere. This has already annoyed many, including Egor himself. It was on this day that the patience of many broke.

It is not known what exactly prompted this to be done: whether it was a cold calculation for survival, or sincere hatred for Bukharin, but anyway, he began to serve not just in the ranks of the army of Nazi Germany, but in the ranks of the SS, organizing the first Russian national SS brigade \"Druzhina\". Gil himself took the call sign \"Rodion\". Nevertheless, the Soviet leadership did not know that he had switched sides, at least he was listed as missing.\n\nevertheless, the service in the SS was relatively short. At first, he effectively destroyed partisan detachments, but later his squad stopped coping with their tasks, and besides, obvious suspicions crept in that he himself collaborated with the partisans. We obviously won't know this anymore, only Gil himself knows the whole truth. For this, the command sent Gil to the border of the \"A-A\" line, and perhaps already at this time he figured out how he would switch back to the side of the Reds.\n\nShortly before the start of the West Russian War, he and his detachment switched sides with the West Russian Revolutionary Front, specifically in the area where Tukhachesvky was. To all questions about what he was doing, he said that he was in captivity and was forced to cooperate. They believed him, and he was immediately assigned to manage a couple of divisions that were under the command of the Red Napoleon. Gil himself, in addition to this, also handed over many of his  former employees, from which during the war they especially searched for certain persons for a long time in order to punish them in full. Sometimes, by the hand of Gil himself.\n\nAfter another defeat from the Germans,Gil found a glimmer of hope for the Russian people in the ideas of the Mladorossi, who were led by Kazem-bek, and eventually, 2 years after the end of the West Russian War, he secretly fled from the ranks of the Russian Communist Party and found himself in Berezniki."

We are going through an important stage in the formation of the Mladorossi State, namely the establishment of a clear vertical of power. Establishing control over power is establishing control over people. This is the paradise that we must build, because people suffer from their freedom. Evil, betrayal and much more comes from a person. I hope you understand?\n\nEveryone except Shafarevich nodded their heads. Shafarevich said reproachfully:\n-Control over a person will turn him into an animal, and not into a conscientious person. We must set an example and guide him along the right path of becoming a superman, and not kill the "human" in him.\n\nGil took a little pause and began to answer:\n-At least I'm glad that we have common ideas, but different ways. And your main mistake is that you consider freedom to be truly human nature. The fact that it defines a person. Society and the surrounding world define a person. He is already dependent, and this dependence protects him from various troubles. Anyone who says that with complete freedom he will be happy is a fool. Therefore, our task is to protect him and let him live a conscientious and correct life. Therefore, I instruct Shafarevich to draw up something similar to a Table of Ranks, and I instruct Serov to follow the whole process and its execution.

 berez_eco.37.d:0 "A sudden phone call connected only with Vyatka in Kazem-bek's office forced him to get out of work into reality. Kazem-bek immediately began to worry before picking up this phone, because it was obvious that only Tsar Vladimir III himself could have called him, against whom Kazem-bek had been set up for a very long time. But after 3 seconds, Alexander pulled himself together again and he had the courage to pick up the phone and lean it against his ears. \n\nA conversation began between the governor and Vladimir, and judging by the tone in which this communication took place, it was possible to understand that the “Big Brother” was dissatisfied with what Kazem-bek was doing in secret from his eyes. When asked how the tsar found out everything, he invariably replied: \"Little bird told me.\" It became clear to Alexander that the tsar's influence was too great on Berezniki, and in order to bargain for a second chance for himself, he had to justify himself for a long time and painfully, inventing everything on the go so as not to simply fly off his post. \n\nHaving come up with perhaps a dozen excuses, he was still able to bargain for a second chance at life and the existence of Berezniki. Vladimir said that he would forgive him for these antics, but only once, and demanded that this should not happen further, otherwise... \n\nAfter putting down the phone, Kazem-bek sighed calmly, but the thought that he could not escape from under Vladimir's heel squeezed him. This suggests that the influence of the tsar is too strong, and that it is necessary to act even more covertly. Next time, such a failure will cost everything – the idea of the Mladorossi Russia, Berezniki, and the very life of Kazem-bek."

The troops on the border with her did not prevent the passage of such an important person and a whole column of troops, as well as other law enforcement forces meeting Solzhenitsyn. The purpose of this man was to fulfill the commission of the tsar himself – to seize Kazem-bek and shoot him for treason to the tsar. \n\nAfter a few hours of driving, Solzhenitsyn and his squad surround the residence of Kazem-bek, and he and his men enter the building. Entering the building, they arrest all members of the government and disarm the guards. The last one was Kazem-bek himself. \n\n— There are the troops of His Imperial Majesty Vladimir III. We call on Kazem-bek to resign his duties and leave this office! Otherwise, we will kick down the door and enter!Kazem-bek, instead of just giving up, decided to resist until the very last. Taking out his loaded pistol, he aimed at the door from where this small detachment was supposed to go. Having received no response, Solzhenitsyn ordered the door to be broken down, but the door was of good quality and in order not to waste time, he simply said to blow it up with a grenade. \n\nThe grenade explosion stunned Kazem-bek a little, but he immediately realized that the assault on his office had begun. So, apparently, the end of Alexander has come, and therefore he decided to shoot the whole store at people. \n\no sooner had the dust settled than the shooting began. Judging by the sound, Kazem-bek hit one of the soldiers, but the rest of the bullets apparently went past and only near these soldiers. The soldiers also shot the whole room with their assault rifles, where they hit Kazem-bek in the upper part of the body. Several bullet wounds made Alexander weak and he fell to the floor. \n\nSolzhenitsyn approached Kazem-bek and he said: — I feel sorry for you. But you betrayed all of us here, and you should be punished. \n\nAfter that, a shot to the head and a couple of shots to the torso finally finished off Mladorossi leader."

The entire top of the government was arrested and most likely has already gone to Vyatka. However, the last of the Mladorossi was Vladimir Gil, a general who was in the troops at that moment. \n\nHaving received the news of the seizure of power in Berezniki and the death of Kazem-bek, he immediately understood what to do. He began his activities aimed at returning power to the hands of the Mladorossi, and he immediately announced to all the armed forces of Berezniki that the army was marching on the city. The army immediately sided with Gil and they followed him into the city. \n\nAll  Solzhenitsy's attempts to stop Vladimir Gil  were unsuccessful – the small detachment that he had was defeated by Gil's regular troops. Continuing their way to the city, the inhabitants of the country supported the general in every possible way all the way to Berezniki. \n\nTwo days later, Vladimir Gil's troops began to surround the city, making sure that no one entered or left there. Vladimir Gil himself and his small detachment enter the city itself and destroy the last survivors of Solzhenitsyn's army, and later reach the very residence where the government of the old Berezniki was located a little earlier. Soon, Solzhenitsyn was captured and overthrown. Vladimir announced that there had been a counter-coup in favor of the power of the Mladorossi and now no one would dare to disturb the peace of his people."

Our victory was achieved thanks to our wise leadership and the faith of our people in the Mladarossi ideal! The Aryan leadership has been captured and are now safely in custody, and soon we will place them on trial so that they can answer for their perfidious crimes.\n\nThe so-called Aryans placed their own people in chains, both figuratively and literally. Having placed their Russian kinsmen in slavery and bondage, they forced them to work endlessly until they collapsed of exhaustion, thirst, hunger or exposure. The small minority of savages who ruled this slave-state drove themselves to madness, considering themselves to be part of the German race and superior to their fellow Russians. These prejudices, however far-fetched, have had a destructive effect on the bodies and minds of their former subjects, and for the sake of decency we must free the Russian people from the Aryan shackles!"
 berez_voina.1.t:0 "Break the Shackles"
 berez_voina.1.d:0 "During hostilities with the Aryan Brotherhood, our soldiers found people in mines and factories who were shackled and bound like animals, surrounded by the ominous symbol of the swastika. Usually, they were found in small groups of two to three people, and when we asked what had happened to them they told us to our horror that they were slaves. In addition, we have been told that there are many thousands more people like them in the former territory of the Brotherhood. It was particularly distressing to learn that in the course of our short conflict, the Gestapo wardens began to shoot a large number of their slaves, commanded by their leaders to prevent their escape and to conceal the truth of their brutal living conditions from the Mladarossi government. It is clear that they failed to carry out their orders in full.\n\nAs we found more groups of survivors, the advance detachments immediately reported their discovery up the chain of command, and news quickly reached the generals behind the line. Upon hearing the news, Kazem-Bek quickly sent out an order to release all slaves discovered within the occupied territories. After the Aryan Brotherhood capitulated, it became clear that many more slaves in their remaining territory had yet to be freed, and thus Kazem-Bek issued a general order for the army to sweep the land for any remaining slaves and enforce their freedom. The freed slaves were of course grateful to their new leader, but sadly many will face a long period of rehabilitation and recovery due to being worked to the brink of death in factories and mines.\n\nAmong the survivors of slavery, there are at least 200 people who wished to join the army in order to defend their new homeland from the marauding warlords who would force them back into servitude. Berezniki granted them freedom, so these 200 brave souls in turn felt a duty to repay that debt in full.\n\nJust as we see to the future of the Russian people, we must consider the future of the hateful robbers and murderers who had enslaved them. Many natural born Russians had chosen new German sounding names for themselves, and convinced themselves beyond all logic that they were not Russians, but Aryans. They considered themselves superior to all others, considering themselves “Ubermensch”, clearly following the example of the Nazi occupiers. Their existence was changed and restrained by their mind-forged manacles, and they sought to expunge any behaviour or practice that would connect them to their true Russian heritage rather than their imagined Aryan one. If we want to get rid of this harmful influence, we must start by making everyone understand that we are all Russian people. Kazem-Bek will make a decree that the entire population of the Aryan Brotherhood will have to take new Russian names and surnames. All the posters and symbols of the Aryan Brotherhood should be destroyed demonstratively in public view, and will instead be replaced by symbols of Russian national identity. These measures will force the long-indoctrinated population to dispense with such strange German names and practices in favour of their Russian heritage."

Although we were able to save people from their depravity and stopped their insane campaign in its tracks, there are still people who, despite being taken into custody, still pose a threat to our way of life.\n\nGutrum Wagner, the originator of this so-called Aryan cancer, is still alive. While he is alive, his simple existence on God’s earth will poison the Russian people with his unholy ideas. Moreover, as long as his associates are still alive, they too may conspire and whisper from behind their cell bars in a manner that could bring chaos to the Russian nation. They aspired to become like our greatest enemy, and in doing so they have proven themselves deserving of the harshest punishments that civilisation can provide for them."
 berez_voina.2.t:0 "The Trial of Wagner and his Henchmen"
 berez_voina.2.d:0 "After the liberation of Perm and the collapse of the Aryan forces, Kazem-Bek immediately ordered the army to block the streets and search house by house until Wagner and his associates were taken into custody. Sure enough, the coward Wagner tried to escape his fate, and was found clutching numerous pieces of jewelry and silverware in the back seat of an official car just a block away from his headquarters by a detachment sent there to detain him.\n\nThe soldiers forced Wagner out of the car, apparently knocking out several of his teeth in the process. Although testimony from the soldiers present varies, it is believed that the broken fingers on his right hand and the lacerations along the side of his head may also be the result of the circumstances in which he was removed from the vehicle. In any case, the so-called “Fyurer” of Perm found his way to the newly opened detention facility in the city, along with many of his close supporters who surrendered peacefully when they realised that their prospect of escape was non-existent. Following their imprisonment, our security agency was ordered to begin searching their headquarters and their personal effects for any document that could provide proof of deliberate crimes against the Russian people. Unfortunately, Wagner had already given an order to destroy any documentation relevant to our investigation before our troops entered the city, and although his underlings failed to destroy everything, much of the relevant material was lost forever, with many facets of their cruel regime consigned to the unknowns of history.\n\nDespite this disappointing absence of documents, what we were able to retrieve was more than enough to secure a death sentence. In addition, the documentary evidence we did discover was confirmed by the testimony of several thousand slaves and many former associates of his who mistakenly believed that their co-operation could lead to them being spared a suitable sentence.\n\nAfter a very short time to clear the venue of rubble and debris, the trial of Wagner and his associates began. It was decided to hold the trial and publicly as possible, using film and photography to capture every moment of the proceedings. Perm - or rather Permhaym as it had come to be called - was chosen as the venue to impose the new regime’s authority on the area. Although Kazem-Bek had already ordered the city to be renamed back to Perm, the trial itself took place under the old city name due to the haste of its organisation.\n\nWagner’s trial took place over the course of a single day, with several short breaks. Most of the trial consisted of the reading of a long list of evidence and testimony regarding the leader of the Aryan gang. Although he denied everything, all the witnesses present, many of whom had served him loyally as underlings, were unanimous in testifying against him.\n\nAs soon as presentation of evidence came to a close, Wagner was seen recoiling in his chair, apparently resigned to his fate. His eyes had become empty, and his demeanour betrayed his feelings of confusion and fear. The verdict was of course guilty, and the court passed the sentence of death by firing squad to the disappointment of many more bloodthirsty spectators who despaired to give such an animal a clean death.\n\nJust 12 hours after the trial, the verdict was proclaimed once more in the prison yard, and shortly thereafter five rounds of bullets were dispatched from the rifles of the assembled riflemen and into the traitor’s heart. Wagner, at the last moment before his demise, was heard to shout “Heil Gutrum!” in some pathetic celebration of his own miserable character. It was later noted that the Fyurer of Permhaym had pissed himself in fear.\n\nThe same procedure was repeated with all the other condemned associates, including many who had testified against their fellow bandits in a futile attempt to save their own skin. There was no time for pompous pathos in their march to the grave, and several men were denied the catharsis of repentance by the sudden crack of firing rifles. Surely, in whichever depth of damnation we have consigned them, the hand of divine justice will see them punished for their crimes forever and ever."

Perhaps we will be able to persuade the monks to join our cause peacefully."
 berez_voina.3.t:0 "Evening conversation"
 berez_voina.3.d:0 "Kazem-Bek shivered for warmth near the entrance to the old hut. A frigid evening wind howled relentlessly through the street. Near the gate of the courtyard, his guards regarded the strange, armed monks with a displeased stare. Yet there was something surprising about the fact that neither time nor German ordnance was able to level the structure. This was not how Kazem-Bek had imagined his meeting with the Grand Master of the Order of St George. He had imagined negotiations between finely dressed diplomats in an ornate church, some hidden sanctuary of theocratic opulence left hidden away in Western Russia. Although Antipin formally agreed to negotiate with his mediators, he still demanded a personal meeting with Kazem-Bek. Perhaps he was reckless, or some blind idealist, believing too firmly in his ideals to entertain any other course than his own. In any case, inviting a personal meeting so quickly was strange behaviour on the part of this leader of warrior monks.\n\nSoon, the leader of the Young Russians mustered the courage to knock on the door. It quickly opened, and beyond it stood a man clad head to toe in monastic attire, who beckoned him inside warmly. The hut was not richly furnished, and contained only a bed, a table and a stove. The only embellishment to this humble mode of living was the presence of what appeared to be religious icons, which hung in abundance on the walls. There was already a heated samovar on the table, as well as a couple of cups. The monk, Mikhail, was the first to strike up conversation.\n\n\"You want my people to join you, if I understood correctly\" the Grand Master began.\n\n\"I believe I have made my intentions abundantly clear\" the regent answered dryly.\n\n\"Well then, I’ll ask you a couple of important questions for my own sake. I hope you don’t mind. You want to return the soviets to Russian soil - the very ones used to cement the power of the god-hating Bukharin. So-called workers councils convened atop a mound of skulls of those who disagreed, their heads severed by the sickle, their churches destroyed by the hammer. Do you really wish such a fate on Russia again?\"\"No, I do not. I do not propose the grant the soviets the same level of power than they enjoyed under Bukharin’s tyrannical rule. We will not let the advice of any soviet threaten the position of the church, nor will we allow them to forget that the true power in this country should lie with its Tsar, and that it is his will that holds the force of law.\"\n\n\"Perhaps your ideas have merit, Kazem-Bek. Remember though that a simple idea is not enough. Will you be able to reassemble Russia, pull it from the kingdom of darkness, and set it on a noble path?\"\n\n\"You have no need to doubt me, Grand Master.\" Kazem-Bek replied, as he retrieved a photograph from his pocket. It was Wagner, tied to a post in the prison yard moments before his demise. A patch of white cloth affixed atop his heart marked the spot where the bullets would shortly find their mark.\n\nThe Grand Master carefully regarded the photo, \"So it is thanks to you that we have heard no word of the Aryans in the past few weeks? Wagner and his gang... they deserved nothing less.\"\n\nThe conversation drew out over the next few hours, as the two men slowly emptied the samovar of tea to keep themselves warm. They considered the goals of the Mladorossi, Russia’s past, the will of God and the fate of man. The discussion wound to a close as Antipin conceded \"Now I feel I finally understand you, Kazem-Bek. My people will follow you wherever you go.\""

 berez_voina.4.d:0 "The process of integrating the Gayny administration is just as peculiar as the order itself. It’s integration causes difficulties for our own government that can be just as acute as direct conflict. The militant monks, having long concerned themselves solely with defending their borders from attack, are ill prepared to assume the duties of civilian local government. Likewise, local residents, having long looked to the men of cloth for guidance, are ill prepared to embrace change. In order to solve the growing issue, two radically different proposals have been presented.\n\nThe first proposal calls for a decrease in the secular autonomy of the order and the integration of their warrior monks into the regular armed forces. Even if this is not an easy process, it would permit us to transform their poorly trained and equipped militiamen into proper soldiers to help us further the unification of Russia.\n\nThe second plan involves the complete relegation of the order to monastic life, and thus an end to their role as administrators and warriors. We anticipate that such a drastic step might lead to some discontent on the part of the monks, but if further extension of our government’s rule over the territory fails we will be left with little other choice.\n\nOne way or the other, we must make a choice."

 berez_voina.5.t:0 "War planning"
 berez_voina.5.d:0 "At the main headquarters of the army there are perhaps a hundred different topographical maps, most of which were of sufficient quality to plan the forthcoming campaign. Among all these maps were examples from both the West Russian War and the Great Patriotic War. There were also newer maps of various states on the territory of Western Russia - among them the now defunct Aryan Brotherhood, Berezniki’s original extent, and even the West Russian Revolutionary Front. A less detailed map existed of Western Russia as a whole, along with the territory of Vyatka.\n\nVladimir Gil is a very capable military specialist that even Tukhachevsky, one of the most powerful marshals in the entire Soviet Union, drew influence from during the West Russian War. From time to time, this map would consult the maps, looking at important cities, towns, villages, as well as supply lines, mountains, hills, forests and anything that lay atop or inbetween. With the movements of his eyes, he charted a path for the men to follow.\n\nGil was examining a map of Vyatka and collecting a report on the combat readiness of the troops when Sergei Belozersky entered his office.\n\n\"Oh, have you already received Kazem-Bek’s orders?\" Belozersky asked to a surprised Gil.\n\n\"What orders?\" Gil replied curiously.\n\n\"His orders to prepare for an attack against Vyatka.\" Belozersky answered.\n\n\"I’m not sure whether an immediate attack against Vyatka would be wise,\" said Gil in response, \"I was just looking at the map of their territory, and it's clear that attacking them involves a far longer front and supply chain than our conflict against the Aryans did.\"\n\n\"Well, what would you propose we do about that?\"\n\n\"If we are really committing to a war with Vyatka, we need to use the distance between our border and their capital to our advantage. 450 kilometres is a long way, and it will take time for our forces to cover the terrain whilst exposing themselves to attack. The most important thing we can do before we begin our march to the capital is to secure Izhevsk, the main centre for their weapons production.\"\n\n\"And I suppose Vladimir knows perfectly well that without his most important weapons production centre, he can’t defeat us?\"\n\n\"Precisely, and therefore we can surmise that he will have concentrated his forces in the area. This will also provide us with the opportunity to strike secondary targets, as it is likely he will place enormous emphasis on Izhevsk alone.\"\n\n\"Don’t forget that Vladimir will also need to defend the main highway between Vyatka and Perm. But he will have to make a choice - try to defend everything at once, try to defend the highway, or defend Izhevsk. Whatever he chooses, we will have the initiative, since no matter what choice he makes he will face problems from our concentrated strike. By defending Izhevsk, he leaves the way open to Vyatka, by defending the highway he leaves the way open to Izhevsk, and by distributing his forces he leaves them open to heavy losses and the eventual fall of both.\"\n\nSergei nodded. \"Don’t forget however that there is a third option - a protracted war - in which case it would be better if we did not suffer major losses in this initial strike. Even in the first two cases you described, we run the risk of being hit in the rear by his troops when they realise that they have been flanked.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest we do about that?\" replied Vladimir.\n\n\"We will have to try to hold back the enemy by fighting until our troops, who have pulled ahead, have fulfilled their objectives.\"\n\n\"That sounds good from a strategic perspective, but in that case we’d need to be in combat with them almost constantly, which could greatly undermine our military power and exhaust the men.\"\n\n\"It will be gruelling and frankly absolutely shit for the men. But the fact is that we have no other choice.\"\n\nGil regarded the plans closely. \"Either way, our plan seems good enough for us to be able to use our initiative to the fullest. So long as we preserve that initiative, we will be able to defeat Vyatka.\"\n\nIt took more than a week to develop the plan further. Ultimately the plan found approval from the rest of the military hierarchy, and the operation came to be known as the \"New Revolution\"."

He was alone in the car - aside for the chauffeur, who knew how to get to the residence. As he watched the scenery go by, he looked back on his own memories of the man. Former friends, they came together to fight in Western Russia, before parting ways on ideological lines. Whilst their schism was regrettable, it was clear that any delay in pressing the advantage against Vyatka would likely have led to Vladimir launching an attack of his own.\n\nAfter a few hours on the road, the car pulled up at Vladimir’s residence. The place had not been damaged during hostilities, since few people could even reach it. There was not a guard or indeed any person at all in sight, since Vladimir had already been taken under house arrest on Kazem-Bek’s orders. \n\nHaving acquainted himself with the empty mansion, he gave the order to have Vladimir brought back from his confinement, and in all due haste Vladimir was bundled into a vehicle and over. After exchanging a series of unusually pleasant greetings, Kazem-Bek was sure to remind Vladimir of the regrettable circumstances under which they were meeting. He beckoned Vladimir up to a second floor dining room, passing the portraits of several Romanov Tsars - among them Alexander III and Nicholas II. There was a large table in the centre of the hall, upon which many opulent and decadent banquets were no doubt hosted. The two men sat down at this table, its surface still neatly decorated with table linens and finery as though a great meal was about to be served. It could not be said that the former ruler of Vyatka was a poor man. Vladimir asked politely for something to eat, having apparently been dissatisfied with the rations he was provided in custody. Kazem-Bek, out of pragmatism as much as respect, ordered his people to prepare a suitable lunch.\n\nWith lunch out of the way, Kazem-Bek shared his vision of the future with Vladimir.\n\n“Vladimir, I should tell you now that we have certain plans for your daughter, Maria Romanova.”\n\n“What kind of plans? Should I be worried?” Vladimir replied cautiously. \n\n“We have considered her as a potential ruler for the new Russian state. As it happens, I myself will not be able to rule much longer due to the political ramifications of a so-called foreigner governing Russia, and after this whole mess in Western Russia has finally been resolved, I want her to be considered among the applicants for the Russian throne.”\n\n“The applicants?” Vladimir frowned. “So it might turn out that she doesn’t rule Russia after all?”\n\n“Precisely, as after the end of the troubles we intend to hold a Zemsky Sobor, and only then will we select from among the possible candidates, one of whom will be your daughter. If the council votes for her, then she will become the Queen. If she becomes the Queen, then until she becomes an adult and independent, I will be her regent.”\n\n“And what if she isn’t chosen?”\n\n“Then she will be sent back to you - her father - so that you can educate her and raise her as you wish. We would not ask anything more of her, nor of you.”\n\n“What do you plan to do with me, though?”\n\nKazem-Bek grimaced. “As I said Vladimir, I plan to do nothing. I politely suggest you think twice about engaging in any further political activity, however. I could return your servants, your residence and your lesser titles of nobility, but in return you would vow never to emerge in the public sphere again. You would be Vladimir the nobleman, who hosts guests, holds parties and patronises charitable causes, but you must never interfere in the politics of the country. \n\nVladimir paused to consider Kazem-Bek’s words, then nodded meekly. “I’m sad that it's all turned out this way, but I’m grateful for a second chance. I will hope and pray for the success of your new government.”\n\nHis business concluded, Kazem-Bek made his way back to Berezniki to continue the next phase of war planning, whilst Vladimir relaxed in an armchair and pondered the first days of his new, more peaceful life."

Such personnel should not be wasted, and we must recruit them for our service.\n\nYes, they are most likely accomplices of Vladimir’s foul schemes and at one time helped him to achieve power by killing Russian people for his self-serving goals. In a just world, they should be condemned to die like animals just as we dispensed with Wagner and his henchmen, but they have a chance to atone for their guilt."
 berez_voina.7.t:0 "Changing the Colour"
 berez_voina.7.d:0 "After the end of the war, there are many generals in prison who were on the side of Vladimir III. Many of these generals are diehard ideological supporters of the defeated Vyatkan cause, and they have served their fallen Tsar since the time of the West Russian War, bearing the stigma of collaborators as a result. Despite the fact that they are enemies of the Russian people, having sided with the Germans, they are nevertheless good military specialists who showed worthy resistance to our troops during the hostilities. This suggests that their moral failings could be selectively ignored on pragmatic grounds. \n\nIt would, of course, still be enjoyable to line them all up against a wall and see their brains blown out, but such an act of macabre theatre would not confer any long term benefit for the motherland. We must once again show mercy. The army of Berezniki is still lacking significantly in senior officers due to the very limited recruitment pool we began with, so to ensure our army avoids descending into anarchy, we should recruit at least some of these generals into our service.\n\nBelozersky instructed his subordinates to bring the generals a proposal to take the military oath of Berezniki and the Young Russia Party and commence their new military service immediately, in exchange for a general amnesty. The proposal was warmly received by all the generals, but nevertheless they proved reluctant to take the oath to Kazem-Bek himself. In their hubris, they insisted that the Mladorossi were traitors to the legitimate Russian monarchy. Some in their ranks insisted that by fighting alongside them in the war against the Revolutionary Front, we too were serving the Tsar and in turning away from them we had betrayed him and Russia itself. Whereas some named former friends in our ranks, in the same breath they denounced them as traitors and scum.\n\nThen of course, they brought up the Nazis. It is said that whatever misfortune befalls a Russian these days, he can always find a way to tie it back to the fucking Nazis. Without a hint of irony or sarcasm, a disheveled looking officer argued that when faced with a red plague, it is a moral duty to take up arms against it, even if it comes at the price of fighting alongside a longtime enemy. \n\nAfter the aforementioned officer received several fists to the face and a hard kick to the groin, it dawned on the men that letting such morally bankrupt officers into the wild would be dangerous, let alone putting them in command of military units. Yet among the entire ideological staff there were two people who agreed to swear the oath regardless. Evgeny Eduardovich Messner, an ideological anti-communist, agreed to take the oath under the pretext of fighting the Communists. He argued that to do so was preferable to languishing in prison and seeing the motherland divided permanently between various warlords. He perceived a great deal of overlap between his ideals and ours, although he was somewhat tactless in how he asked for specific answers about our ideology. On the other hand, Georgy Prokipyevich Zagainov agreed completely to our terms, almost without words, to the oath of allegiance to Kazem-Bek and the people of Berezniki. A true laconic officer. \n\nA week later, they solemnly took their oaths of allegiance, changed the colour of their uniforms and entered the service of Mladorossi Russia. Whilst some people raise serious concerns about their loyalty to the new regime, we must treat them according to the principle of “Trust but Verify”. We shall assign them new shadows in the form of secret service agents, who will carefully gather any and all information about their activities. Their lives will thereafter be judged not on what they do in plain sight, but what they do behind our backs."

Most importantly, we were able to defeat the liar Vladimir III, who gave the lives of the Russian people for what little power he enjoyed in Vyatka! The successes of the Young Russians are visible and obvious to anyone outside of Berezniki, with our borders now enlarged far beyond its original extent.\n\nThe Young Russian dream of a people’s monarchy in Russia is being realised right before our eyes, and many are still trying to understand the greatness of this moment. But there are still opponents of our idea around us. In the north, the nominally democratic Komi and the remnants of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. In the west lies Vologda, clinging fanatically to the farcical notion of neutrality, whilst the dogs of Tatarstan and Bashkira lay to the south, trying to hide themselves from view as they eke out a meagre existence like scavenging mongrels hiding in the woods. Further beyond them the KONR controlled territory around Samara, no doubt plotting and scheming further to undermine and sell out the motherland.\n\nRussia is starting to revive, but for now our leadership must continue to advance the cause in small steps, and we must therefore draw up a new plan of action."

The military order has been attached almost without problems, the Aryan hydra was finally slain and we overthrew the liar Vladimir III. These successes show that our carefully laid plans were well advised, and the efforts of our brave men and women were not in vain. Already we can appreciate the new kind of order that we have been able to provide for our admittedly very small territory in Russia. That isn’t to say that we should rest on our laurels - the war for western Russia is far from over, and our enemies still surround us. From the north, west and south they approach our borders, and this depressing expectation of another attack is even more worrying than before. We must plan, plan, plan. \n\nKazem-Bek, Belozersky, Gil and the rest of the generals gathered in the main office of the Berezniki administration. Kazem-Bek talked about the prevailing military situation in the region and listed the towns and strategic points along the new border. The tension was such that every man considered his words carefully, for giving poor military counsel could bring disaster down on Berezniki in a matter of weeks. As a proverbial David between two relative Goliaths - the KONR and WRRF, it was clear that they had to make a very carefully considered calculation regarding who to attack first. \n\nHaving put this question to the generals, Kazem-Bek received a steady stream of proposals. One man argued that it would be preferable to consolidate the possessions of weaker warlords first, before fighting the larger tow. Gil and Belozersky, on the other hand, proposed to strike south in one great push, capturing all territory on the way to Samara. This initiative was supported by Zagainov, but opposed by Messner, who argued that it might instead be necessary to align with the KONR temporarily to defeat the WRRF. He argued that it would be better to have one ally and one enemy than fight a two front war. \n\nAs much as his plan for a temporary alliance seemed sensible, the ideological case for attacking the KONR seemed to outweigh the pragmatic case against it, and few other generals could stomach the idea of fighting alongside Vlasov’s men. Vlasov and his ilk had after all betrayed their motherland in its darkest hour, and could easily do the same again, stabbing us in the back at the most inopportune moment to seize the initiative and take Russia for themselves. Furthermore, if we were to even sit in the same room as one of them, it would seem as if we have chosen to sign a pact with Satan himself, although to make such a comparison would probably be unfair on the devil. \n\nKazem-Bek will as ever be guided by his own political and moral compass, and as it happened his intuition coincided with the military consensus. A decision was therefore made - the military would march south and destroy the fascists and traitors who lurked there, before taking up the fight in the north."

There’s no need to exchange fucking love letters with them!” General Vavilov spoke with mocking tones. \n\nThe General Staff, together with Kazem-Bek, discussed their actions in relation to the state of Bashkira. Ardashev and Volkov, keen to minimise losses, had already argued for equipping pro-Russian elements in Bashkira with weapons and equipment, to displace the incumbent government and replace it with a pro-annexation one. Meanwhile, Vavilov and Volkov had been frequently interjecting, having come to the firm belief that any plan for peaceful annexation was folly, and that a quick dash to Ufa was necessary to prevent any physical resistance by separatists. The discussion had drawn out for several hours, and was punctuated by several colourful insults from both sides that did not make their way onto the official transcript. And yet, Kazem-Bek was silent throughout - suspiciously so. \n\nOnce the generals had finally cooled their tempers, Kazem-Bek got up and began his reflections. \n\n“After listening to you, I had an ambivalent opinion on this interesting situation. Either a coup, spending precious military equipment, which in many cases our army simply cannot spare, or an invasion, which would no doubt cost lives that need not be thrown away. I propose a compromise between your positions.” Kazem-Bek took a neatly sealed envelope from his jacket. “A letter of conscience. Soon I will send it directly to Bashkira for the attention of Akhmet-Zaki Validi himself. I will offer him peaceful accession of Bashkira to Berezniki, as well as very good autonomy within New Russia, with amnesty for their entire government. If they refuse, that will of course be a cause for sadness. I am however not prepared to pause whilst each warlord in our path dithers and delays in the face of our reasonable demands, and if they choose to resist we will of course attack swiftly.

What do you say, generals?”\n\nArdashev listened attentively to Kazem-Bek, and when he finished his long speech he asked, “So we’re sending them an ultimatum? \n\n“That’s right, Ardashev, a very firmly worded one.”\n\nThe generals were silent.

During the collapse of the Front, he proudly led Bashkira in the darkest days, repulsed the bloody raids of the Aryan Brotherhood and protected the majestic expanses of the land from their wrath.

There shall therefore be no forgiveness for the Tatars! Everyone in the room agreed with this sentiment.\n\nThe question remained - what should be done to Tatarstan’s autonomy, as well as the All-Tatar Public Centre who governed the territory? Some in the room argued for a heavy handed approach, with members of the government to be shot one by one whilst Abdullah himself swung to and fro from a short length of rope, but others argued that to shoot everyone indiscriminately would be too cruel.

What joyous news, he thought, were it not for the fact that such a promotion sent him to the lawless land of Tatarstan. They needed experienced officials to restore the territory from the devastation of the war, he had read, and yet he could not help but wonder how he could possibly make his home there, amidst an alien culture and faith. This was of course an order, not a request, so he was in no place to refuse. The very generous salary was also a plus.\n\nIvan came to Kazan with his family. The city was indeed in ruins, but Russian soldiers, together with the Tatar people, rebuilt the city. Unfortunately, that was not enough. All the newly arrived officials had to come to the former government building, which had now been downgraded to housing a simple city council.\n\nArriving there, he noticed shell casings, traces of bullets, dirt and various bits of debris. There were obviously fierce battles going on here just weeks prior. From there he entered the majestic office, which was covered with what looked like gold, where people like him were already sitting at a round table. Kazem-Bek himself stood before them.\n\n“Glory to Alexander Lvovich, the great regent!” everyone shouted, and Kazem-Bek beckoned everyone to sit. He began to speak:\n\n“Comrades, Kazan lies in ruins. The Tatars resist our rule. They consider us invaders, but we are not. We brought justice back. Tatars and Russians should live together in peace and harmony. For unity only makes us stronger. You are the people who shall form the foundations of a new Tatarstan. You are the people whom both I and the entire Tatar people look at with hope. We will treat the Tatars as our brothers - we will not touch their faith, their traditions or their culture. They should not be afraid of us, and should come to see us as their friends! You all have great responsibility on your shoulders, and I hope that you will not let me down, or the Tatar people!”\n\n“Yes, glory to Alexander Lvovich!” everyone shouted with even greater enthusiasm."

One could point the finger at Kazem-Bek, who initiated the hostilities, but history is written by the winners. Here in Berezniki, they will try the true culprit behind this apocalyptic war - Abdullah Alish.\n\nKazem-Bek was personally present at the trial. The generals sat next to him in the front row, and the judges presided from the front. In a cage to the side was Abdullah Alish, almost entirely bound in chains. He had noticeably lost weight, and was a shadow of the man he once was. Kazem-Bek felt the power of his triumph over him. It remained only to await the decision of the judges.\n\n“Abdullah Alish, you are sentenced to death for your collaboration, and for your actions that led to the war between Berezniki and Tatarstan. It was YOU who holds ultimate responsibility for the deaths of both the Russian and Tatar peoples! How can any honest man call you the “hero of Tatarstan”? You are permitted to make a final statement before your sentence is carried out.\n\n“Alexander Lvovich Kazem-Bek! You are blind, you are deaf! I defended Tatarstan from your ambitions. I defended Tatarstan from the occupation regime. All I sought was a peaceful sky over the holy land! You still don’t understand, and yet you yourself were born in Kazan, a holy city that you have commanded your men to loot and defile! Do you seriously think that with my death, the Tatar people will submit? They know the truth, a truth that you have tried desperately to hide from others! Remember my words!”\n\nKazem-Bek looked at him all the while, then quietly whispered in the ear of one of his generals. “Finish this off quickly, I’m bored.”\n\nAfter his poorly received speech, Abdullah was dragged outside to the blood-stained wall. Vavilov was more than pleased to throw him against it. \n\n“Soldiers, get ready!”\n\nThe soldiers readied their rifles and aimed at the man who had already resigned himself to his fate. Shots were heard. The body rolled down the wall and fell in its own fresh pool of blood. The collaborator let out his last breath as his soul left for another world."

Time has passed, and the time of devastation and banditry has passed with it.

What remains to be said?” Gil said, perplexed. \n\n“Only one simple matter,” said Kazem-Bek, coughing a little. “You see, when we have an arsenal of tanks at our disposal, we need someone to command them. It surely must be you. I remember when you were able to destroy an army that outnumbered you several times, all thanks to the mobility of the trucks under your command...”\n\n“That’s right Alexander Lvovich, I understand your reasoning,” Gil said, interrupting Kazem-Bek’s speech.\n\n“Yes, yes...

The more equipment they could find, the greater the advantage Berezniki would have over its future opponents. Alexey himself understood this simple fact. He spared no time in regrouping his men and heading to the first warehouse.\n\nThe first warehouse was located south of the city of Gorky, about 10 kilometres from the city, near the village of Kalachevo. The villagers themselves did not suspect that there was a strategically important facility right under their noses in the forest. They finally made it through the woods and found themselves near some kind of dugout, but without a warehouse in sight! Alexey went to the dugout’s door and rubbed it a little. A metallic sheen soon appeared - it was still a warehouse.\n\nAlexey ordered his men to find a passage and to look through the contents of the warehouse. They found the passage, but it was locked, forcing them to use dynamite as sparingly as possible to avoid damaging what lay inside. Some dynamite was crudely piled up by the entrance.\n\n“Get down!” Alexey shouted to his soldiers, who hid behind the trees just in time to avoid the unexpectedly loud explosion that resulted. A large hole had appeared in the wall through which everyone soon entered. The warehouse had conventional weapons, armoured personnel carriers, and some tanks. Of course, the hastily arranged explosion had dealt some damage to nearby equipment, but had little effect on the vehicles parked further within. Alexei asked for a line to the general staff.

Kazem-Bek was not particularly fond of this process, because he felt obliged to listen to such monotonous reports in their excruciating entirety. The content was already the same - percentages unemployed, the poverty rate, platitudes about it being “our” economy and calls for some measure of regulation. So it went. It seemed the pencil pushers were prone to forgetting that Kazem-Bek was a man, not a robot.\n\nBut work was work. This is not just a job, but a debt to Mother Russia. Kazem-Bek got into his black convertible. It was very stuffy in the car, so he took off his coat and left it on the seat beside him. The car started and they headed for Samara. \n\nSeveral hours passed, maybe six, or was it eight? Kazem-Bek did not count, for he had managed to fall asleep on the way. Soon his driver woke him up:\n\n“We’re entering Samara now, wake up Alexander Lvovich!” \n\n“Why the shouting huh? I’m awake god damn it...” Kazem-Bek said sleepily, rubbing his eyes.\n\nIt was already daylight, and people were staring at the car as Kazem-Bek waved out of the window. They soon arrived at the magnificent theatre where the meeting would be held. Kazem-Bek got out of the car and was greeted with a storm of applause. Entering the building itself, he was greeted by his fellow party members, generals, businessmen (of whom there were very few) and some ordinary local officials. The generals and Kazem-Bek were given a place on the only balcony from where he could see everyone from above.\n\nThe meeting commenced soon after. For the first hour Kazem-Bek tried to carefully absorb all the information, occasionally writing  something in his notebook. However, time passed, and Kazem-Bek began to nod off. The generals, sympathising with his tired state, put a pillow beneath his head, sometimes waking him up so that he could add remarks that were better delivered by him personally. Everybody needs rest sometimes!\n\nThe meeting lasted ten hours. The room was very stuffy, so everyone raced for the exit when they finally announced that the meeting was over. Only Kazem-Bek remained, who, having woken up, asked his generals the broad strokes of what was revealed by the reports.\n\nEveryone gave the same view - the economy was stabilising, volunteers are signing up to the army, and the popularity of the Mladorossi was growing every day - praise the regent. That being said, many generals stressed that problems such as unemployment, poverty, poor education, illegal trade, and violations of workers rights remained.

Surprisingly, General Ardashev was able to present a compelling third option:\n\n“Comrades, Generals and Alexander Lvovich! I offer you all a simple but brilliant plan! We are all aware that the democrats have held their ground in the Komi Republic and strengthened their rule over the province. We must therefore take advantage of the pro-Russian sentiments that have emerged there. We will ask the Komi Republic to hold a referendum on joining Berezniki, retaining their provincial institutions and structures. Although we were once a far smaller and less significant state than their own, our control over large stretches of the south should demonstrate our superior bargaining position. I suspect they would be in no position to refuse - declining our offer would cause an outcry from every patriot in the state. And then, god willing, we will win, for if not we will be left with no choice but to invade. Let’s be honest - the chances of defeat are incredibly slim, and in all probability we will soon have annexed Komi without a fight.” Ardashev let out a proud grin as he ended his speech.\n\nThe generals began to bicker among themselves - not because the plan was bad, but because some doubted his confidence regarding the outcome of a referendum. The Komi Republic had existed for a decade now, long enough to create a sense of local identity and separatist viewpoints. Many there seemed to identify not as Russian, but as Komi, with growing overturned being made to the indigenous identity of the region. Such sentiments reduced the chances of victory somewhat, not to mention the risk that the leaders of the Republic could refuse to hold a vote, or to recognise its outcome as legitimate. Thus many generals argued once more for war, whilst others backed Ardashev.\n\n“Not a bad plan Ardashev, I am always in favour of trying the bloodless path first!” said Vavilov wholeheartedly. \n\nThe ultimate decision lay with Kazem-Bek. Getting up from his chair, he nodded towards Ardashev, “Well Ardashev, I’m impressed. This plan is truly brilliant.

However, I cannot see how unification with such an ideologically incoherent state can be of any benefit to us. We are confident that the people of the Republic will also reject any proposal to mingle with this strange system of Tsar and Soviet.”\n\nAleksey Kosygin, leader of the Union of Young Reformers, said, “The unification of Russia is our ultimate objective, as everyone knows. But at what price are we prepared to pursue it? Should we allow our republic to be governed by a regent for an as yet unknown monarch? Should we allow Russia to live under such a regime, without the liberal freedoms we have come to enjoy? These are not things that I would like to see, and yet I recognise that many people would prefer the security of peace and unity in exchange for a loss of personal freedom.”\n\nSvetlana Stalina, leader of the Party of Sovereign Democracy, said, “Why are we even discussing this? Russia needs democracy and moderation, not a crazy regent with mysterious goals! His attempt to synthesise two extreme ideas will fall apart within a few years, and Russia will once again be split between ideological camps! Do we want such a fate? Of course not!”\n\nAlthough the leaders of each party were decidedly negative about the proposals, to the surprise of many a slim majority of deputies cast their votes in favour. Perhaps they were merely tired of standing alone, tired of being a futile beacon of liberal democracy amidst an inferno of despotism and ideological extremism. Perhaps others felt that they could not face their constituents after denying them a voice on such a sensitive matter, or had even been won over to Kazem-Bek’s way of thinking. In any case, the referendum was hastily arranged for a few days time, and the fate of our young nation will be decided once and for all."

The fate of the Republic is being decided - either union with Berezniki, or independence and isolation. The country had quickly divided itself into two camps - some had quickly procured Berezniki flags to hang from their windows, or at least hastily painted them on sheets of cloth. The anti-union campaigners instead went around putting up posters and painting crude murals, emblazoned with the slogan “Let’s not forsake our Democracy”. In Kirovskiy Park, not far from the main government buildings, the two groups of activists came to blows, with one man admitted to hospital with serious head injuries. For many bystanders, it looked as though the chaos of ‘63 was about to repeat itself. \n\nikolai Elkin went to the polls with his family in tow, making his way to his familiar polling station - number 17. His family had all voted for Kosygin in 1963, and had all resolved to vote for unification with Berezniki. Although Berezniki was not a free state, and even though this may be his last direct expression of political will, his children could not survive the chaos and disunity that he had experienced. As a soldier of the USSR and the Front, he twice witnessed the collapse of the country. He wanted his children to live in a united Russia, strong enough to resist its enemies!\n\nAs the night set in, the polling stations closed and the ballot boxes were taken to be counted. The count was to take place overnight, and the results were expected in the morning."

It did not take long for the news to reach Kazem-Bek himself, who reacted with jubilation as the results of the unification vote in Komi were announced earlier today over the radio.\n\n“Well comrades!” he exclaimed in front of the assembled generals, “Today Komi has joined Berezniki. Everyone in Russia should remember this great day! This proves that the people of Russia truly do want reunification, and that this fragmentation of our motherland is but a temporary setback to Russia’s glorious destiny. The Russian people are deserving of a just and prosperous life, and they have voted to claim it!”\n\nShortly thereafter, Kazem-Bek and his generals gathered in diplomatic vehicles and were driven to Syktyvkar, where he intended to celebrate his victory and deliver a speech to the ordinary people of Komi.\n\nThey travelled overnight, with the car arriving in the city in the late morning. It seemed word of their arrival had preceded them, for a crowd of people had already gathered to greet them. A large group gathered alongside them, waving flags of Berezniki and shouting the slogan “Tsar and Soviet” for all to hear. It frustrated Kazem-Bek to notice, however, that a second group had gathered nearby with pickets decrying him and his government as “Killers of democracy”. There were, it seemed, far more critics than Kazem-Bek could ever have expected in the midst of his great democratic triumph.\n\nSoon Kazem-Bek’s car came to a halt outside the government building. Atop its steps a podium had been erected: it was the altar of a new Russia, from which he would consecrate the people’s monarchy for all to see! Kazem-Bek climbed out of the car and began to climb the stairs, wheezing a little as he went. When he reached his place he was surreptitiously handed a sheet of paper by a flustered aide, supposedly the speech he had composed a few days before. No! This was not in the spirit of the moment! Kazem-Bek gently folded up the paper and slipped it into a coat pocket. His words, for the sake of Komi, Berezniki and all Russians, must come from the heart and the soul!\n\n“Citizens of Komi! Citizens of our entire divided Russia! Today marks the peaceful unification of the Komi Republic and Berezniki. Many among you say that this unification will kill the democracy that Voznesensky tried to build. But what is democracy other than a method to secure peace and prosperity from tyrants? Now, in this moment, the greatest guarantee of a bright future is to set aside what we know and embrace change and progress. I recognise that many of you think that my regime, and the Young Russians, are a far cry from the liberties you have come to enjoy, and I can tell that many of you are now afraid for your future. But at the heart of our beliefs is our commitment to justice - drawn from the proud legal tradition of the Tsars and the sweeping social justice of the Soviets! What we give you today is what Russia has cried for throughout its history - justice! We offer you a motherland that looks after the weak and reins in the powerful, preventing the abuses that and excesses of the previous regimes! Our commitment to justice will never waver, not in the face of internal sabotage, nor in the face of German or Japanese guns! We will always be loyal to Russia and its people! HURRAH!” Kazem-Bek shouted menacingly into the microphone.His speech concluded, the crowd stirred with a sense of euphoria and shared purpose as the deflated dissenters grumbled and then skulked away back to their homes and businesses to re-evaluate their future. In one short week, an isolated republic that had once nearly torn itself apart in acrimony had come to embrace a new and just future for the people."

 berez_voina.31.d:0 "Kazem-Bek threw his cup of tea across the room, shattering it into a thousand tiny pieces against the wall. He had heard the news. The traitors in Syktyvkar had rejected unity and abandoned their motherland, and had taken to prancing about the streets, waving the flags of their schismatic government as though they were icons of Christ. \n\nThe generals did not learn of the news from any secretary or from the radio, but rather from the loud stomping and clattering that began to emanate from Alexander Lvovich’s office. The generals, whilst afraid of their regent’s terrible rage, were nonetheless grateful not to have been in the room with him when he heard. As the thumping began to die down, the assembled generals wondered who among them would be entrusted with the unenviable task of consoling Kazem-Bek. Eyes darted around aimlessly before the men settled on Ardashev. \n\n“Why me?” inquired Ardashev.\n\n“He listens to you, go reason with him.”\n\nArdashev sighed. “Gentlemen, if I don’t return, please pass my regards to my family.” \n\nThe generals nodded politely in return. Ardashev stepped slowly and gently across the hall, as though fearful to alert Kazem-Bek to his approach. As he approached the door, he saw the silhouette of the regent huddled on the floor through the frosted glass. He knocked - no response. A second knock - this time an unintelligible grumble. As he opened the door, Ardashev could see Kazem-Bek slumped against the wall, his head in his hands, with numerous items of office equipment strewn about the floor. \n\n“Regent?” Ardashev inquired politely, “I’m very sorry to hear the news - rest assured we did everything we...”\n\nKazem-Bek’s fist suddenly struck the filing cabinet beside him, causing Ardashev to recoil in surprise. \n\n“We did not do everything we could, Ardashev.” replied Kazem-Bek, his eyes still set on the ground. “We trusted the word of an ill-informed electorate, hastily assembled, casting their votes on a proposition they barely comprehend. What is democracy if not an instrument of national salvation? If the people cannot vote to end anarchy and tyranny alike, they are not fit to govern themselves.” \n\nKazem-Bek stood up and dusted himself off before looking Ardashev clearly in the eye.\n\n“You see, democracy is but a tool to advance justice, and with overuse it is bent out of shape. People follow petty ideals, and pursue selfish goals, all the while forgetting their true loyalty - their loyalty to the Russian motherland. That’s why I chose to harness the Soviet system - to take power from the common rabble and place it in the hands of councillors and institutions who could take rational, careful decisions about Russia’s future. Not this.”Ardashev watched silently as Kazem-Bek strode across the room, picking up a metal tray and a ruler from the floor and placing it upon his desk. \n\n“If democracy is a sword to slay tyranny and advance justice,” he said, holding the ruler aloft, “then we are the hammer that bends it into shape. Democracy in Komi is twisted and bent beyond all proportion. The people have been terrorised and misled for far too long to truly understand the magnitude of the decisions they are making.” \n\nKazem-Bek glared at a bemused Ardashev, and made a sweeping motion with his fist down upon the metal tray. “We - Ardashev - are the hammer, and Russia is the anvil. With our might, with the resolve of our people and with the strength of our army, we will bend this sword back into its proper shape, so that it might once again be a weapon against tyranny. This wretched and disgusting verdict of the people will not stand. We shall strike it down with all our force, and smash it against the anvil of the Russian nation. If it does not bend, it will break. Everyone who sees our resolve will know that to betray Berezniki is to betray Russia. Do you understand?”\n\nArdashev blinked. “Yes, Alexander Lvovich. I understand perfectly.”"

Soon, he promised, the banner of the Young Russians would fly proudly over the entire motherland, as it now flew over Komi.\n\nAlthough many are still afraid for the future, everyone knows one thing for sure - Berezniki has further strengthened its position in West Russia, and its vision of national unity looks ever closer.

Many have already forgotten how they felt during the sensational referendum at which the fate of the republic was decided. Many more are already accustomed to the new realities of their life under the rulership of the regent. Nevertheless, the young and pro-democracy strata of the population remain indignant. Still they hang out their flags, organise rallies and administer beatings to those they deem to be “collaborators”. They must be stopped. \n\nKazem-Bek’s order to all former leaders of the Komi Republic to join him for an “important meeting” prompted concern amongst the public. Radio Free Syktyvkar touched upon the topic more than once. What will happen there? What about public employees who were not summoned? Only the generals and Alexander Lvovich himself knew.\n\nPeople gathered in the large Regency Council building, a foreboding building once used as a parliament by a small and isolated Berezniki state. Senior representatives of three parties gathered - the Democratic Socialist People’s Party with Voznesensky, the Party of Young Reformers under Kosygin and the Party of Sovereign Democracy under Stalina. They spoke amongst themselves and gazed anxiously at the empty speaker’s podium before them as they waited to hear from their new overlord. \n\nKazem-Bek emerged from behind the curtains. He was greeted coldly by the audience, but seemed not to notice. Perhaps it hurt his pride to know that he was not yet admired, but he gave no signal of his disapproval. He made his way to the centre of the room as the room maintained a deathly silence. As he stood before the podium, he wiped his sweaty face with a handkerchief, and gave an ominous stare across the room. Silence reigned. A clock slowly ticked. Kazem-Bek looked down at his notes:\n\n“Dear fellow democrats! I called you here to Berezniki for an important reason. Once you were the political lifeblood of the Komi Republic. Now in Berezniki you are of course nothing...”\n\nMany grumbles of displeasure and rude gestures were seen across the chamber as Kazem-Bek spoke his last words, but he continued to speak. “You don’t like it, I know. Although we are ideologically different, there is one thing that binds us - the unification of Russia. I ask you, no, I urge you, to put aside your political differences in service of this goal! We must unite for the sake of the Russian land and the Russian people! Are we not all tired of disunity and rule by warlords? With a united front, we are stronger than anything our enemies can throw at us! I hope that you will be prepared to join the party of Young Russians, the Motherland Party! If you’re ready then don’t be afraid, get up! Stand up to defend the motherland!\n\nKazem-Bek’s words elicited little reaction from the crowd at first. People looked from side to side, willing someone else to be the one to get up first. This was not a choice that Kazem-Bek was offering them - it was an ultimatum. Their republic had fallen, and little could be served by clinging to the old ways. Kosygin stood up. Silence. Kosygin looked around him - he was standing alone.\n\n“Perhaps you’ll call me crazy, but I think it’s time to make peace with events and swear our allegiance. The Mladorossi are the only option I can see. We built a new democracy from the ground up a decade ago - and we can build a new one again in this new state, given time.”\n\nKosygin had simply said what a lot of people had been thinking. One by one, his fellow party members began to rise from their seats, followed by several socialists, and a few of Stalina’s colleagues. They made their strange and unfamiliar oath to their new regent, and parted ways with the reluctant few who had consigned themselves to a descent into obscurity. In doing so, they provided Kazem-Bek with a cadre of good and experienced politicians ready to step up and govern the country."

They walked in silence, contemplating the challenge before them. The group came across a row of benches next to the majestic marble fountain, and sat themselves down. Kazem-Bek was the first to speak:\n\n“Well gentlemen, as you know I didn’t gather you all for a walk in the open air, but to contemplate the fall of Syktyvkar!”\n\n“Regent, the troops are in position along the border as commanded, what else is there to discuss? The men will do their duty as always.” Valilov asked in bewilderment. \n\nArdashev frowned. “Vavilov, Komi’s armed forces are equipped with numerous armoured vehicles. Don’t tell me you aren’t concerned about our men getting mowed down in a reckless frontal assault?”\n\n“How would that be any different to the tanks we encountered in the south? Our men have always proved themselves capable against superior equipment and firepower!” Vavilov proclaimed triumphantly. \n\n“Do not quarrel, comrade generals” interjected Kazem-Bek, “An aggressive attack can be used if we are careful to consider our enemy’s strengths and weaknesses. Volkov has already assessed what we know of their army and considered plans to counter them.”\n\nVolkov nodded, “Our strike groups will be directed at Syktyvkar itself - with motorised divisions attempting to take the city before Komi can group up their own mechanised units. If this does not work, and the city is somehow capable of resisting, then the same motorised divisions will turn back and force their frontline divisions into pockets, cutting them off from their supplies.

 berez_voina.35.d:0 "Sergeant Kirill Yusupov, along with ten soldiers, was ordered to search the government prison, located far away from civilisation. Kirill did not like nature. Why was it necessary to build a prison far out in the wilderness? Orders were orders, anyway. His soldiers clambered into the truck.\n\nThey drove for about an hour to the location of the prison. The weather was cool, and the breeze blew in Kirill’s face through the open window. The sun was just out of sight below the tree line, casting ominous shadows along the ground. The foreboding view of the building ahead unnerved Kirill a little, but he did not let it show. As they arrived at the building, they were surprised to see no men guarding the prison, and the entrance gate wide open. It stands to reason that they had fled days before.\n\n“Come on, move your asses! We don’t have much time!”\n\nThe prisoners, for their part, remained crammed inside the prison, and the soldiers went cell to cell releasing any prisoner not explicitly listed as a political detainee. As instructed, they were to offer any political prisoner the regent’s choice - join the Mladorossi, or die. This was the order from the top, there was no questioning Kazem-Bek. That of course left open some room for personal persuasion on Kirill’s part - if he was able to get a senior leader to choose life and join the Young Russians, he would surely be promoted.\n\nOne last cell remained. Too many gunshots for Kirill’s liking - the regent would be displeased if too few officials returned with them today. Perhaps caged animals were prone to making foolish choices, when facing the barrel of a gun. The stench hit them first. As they peered into the cell, the emaciated corpse that lay within - its flesh in a fairly advanced state of decay - was flanked by two ghostly figures who proved difficult to identify at first. Whilst no doubt alive, they looked painfully thin, and were covered in filth from head to toe. They, as it turned out, were Kosygin and Stalina. \n\nThe corpse had a hole in its head. The hole had seemingly been made some time ago, because maggots had made their home inside. The skin was almost completely decayed now, and the eyes had rolled out of their sockets and onto the wooden floor. Kirill could tell - if not by sight but by inference - that this was the corpse of Voznesensky. He quickly excused himself from the cell and vomited against a corridor wall. The ghostly, broken pair who had been his companions were gently escorted from their pit of nightmare and provided with some much needed medical assistance. \n\nFifteen minutes passed. Kirill had ordered his men to carry the dead from the cells and make some attempt to burn them in the forest, so as not to leave such a mess. It did not matter if they were never to return here - no man should witness such a grizzly scene here again. Kirill was now standing in the makeshift medical room with Kosygin, waiting as he was treated. He had already freed Stalina - he knew that she would refuse, and he was not the sort of sick fuck who would kill a defenceless woman. Kosygin was still shaking a little as the medic handed him a sequence of pills to take, for he seemed consumed only by the hell that he had experienced. \n\nKirill broke the silence “Comrade Kosygin, I would be very pleased if you joined the Mladorossi. Many of your colleagues have done the same, and a man of your talents could serve the people well once again.”\n\nKosygin understood the dynamics of this offer. He had heard the gunshots. He knew the brutality of man. He knew that he could serve or he could soon find his body hollowed out by maggots as his dearly departed friend did. \n\n“Yes, yes, I will join the Mladorossi...” Kosygin whispered faintly."

Our troops have yet to fully pacify the Communist agitants still engaging in petty acts of vandalism and assault in the streets of Syktyvkar, but we have been able to transport their ringleaders to Berezniki for trial - Boris Ponomarev, Andrei Zhdanov and Svetlana Bukharina. Each occupied a different faction within their Communist Party, but they all share culpability and guilt for their actions against Russia and against societal order. \n\nKazem-Bek personally attended the trial to give his personal “advice” to the judges before the start of the trial. Many present already knew what awaited them. The well-rehearsed practice of trying the state’s enemies soon began. Thus began a detailed description of the life of the convicts, and their influence of the Communist Party of Komi. Soon the chief judge, who had hitherto listened attentively to the presentation without taking notes or allowing interruption, looked over at the three convicts and began his speech:\n\n“Today these defendants have come to answer to the serious charges pressed against them. We are now ready to announce our verdict against these henchmen of the Communists. The first verdict is with regard to this black horse of the party, namely Boris Nikolayevich Ponomarev...” the judge turned to the old man, who coughed a little, “For your wretched political activities, tyranny, promotion of anarchy and treason to the Motherland, you are sentenced to capital punishment - death!”\n\nThe witness gallery began to talk frantically between them. Ponomarev was a broken shell of a man, reduced to a mere shadow of himself by his captivity, and the punishment seemed unexpectedly severe. It was customary to spare at least one defendant in group trials such as these so as to demonstrate the Regent’s boundless capacity for mercy, and most had expected Ponomarev to be the defendant spared the firing squad. \n\n“Our next convict is Andrei Aleksandrovich Zhdanov, “the judge said, turning to Zhdanov as Ponomarev was dragged from the room, “For his political activities and participation in terror against the Russian people, he should be sentenced to death!”\n\nZhdanov bowed his head down in resignation, fully expecting the guards to pull him from his seat and drag him to the firing squad at any moment.\n\n“...however because of his scientific work and illness, the court finds mitigating circumstances that spare him the death penalty in this case. Instead, I sentence the defendant to 20 years in prison.” Zhdanov looked about him in shock, wholly unprepared for the sudden reprieve. \n\n“Svetlana Nikolaevna Bukharina,” said the judge, locking eyes with the defendant who glared back at him, “You are merely a shadow of your father. You have fulfilled his legacy of failure and you are an embarrassment to the Russian people. I would have him shot if he were here today, but I will not punish you for his far greater sins. This court sentences you to 10 years imprisonment with hard labour for your political activities and your participation in war against the legitimate Russian government. This trial is now over.”\n\nThe remaining convicts were escorted from the room to their fates, whilst just outside a truck started to take Ponomarev to that special place where the regent saw fit to send traitors to their maker. Kazem-Bek was pleased. Bukharin might have died an ignominious death over two decades ago, but his true death, and the death of his legacy, came here as the last dismal prophets of the Bolshevik faith were cast down by the righteous hand of the Mladorossi."

In the end, the courtroom was packed with as many spectators as it could safely handle, aside for the space made around Kazem-Bek and his generals on the balcony to ensure their safety and comfort. Alexander Lvovich looked down at the faces of two convicts who had just been brought into the room. Two men in white shirts, one older and the other younger. The older one was Lev Gumilyov, the Eurasianist, and the younger one was some allegedly conservative fool - Igor Shafarevich. \n\nThe Chief Justice directed his first remarks at Gumilyov. He spoke about the man’s life, before launching into a lengthy diatribe about the failings and delusions of his Eurasianist theory. No doubt the man was keen to pander to his unexpectedly large audience with the litany of insults he deployed. After what seemed like an hour of calling Gumilyov a crazed traitor and a murderer, the judge paused for a moment, as if to catch his breath.\n\next it was Shaferevich’s turn to face the music. The judge also began to describe his life, his academic work, and finally his political activities. Next the judge delivered a mocking impression of Shafarevich’s voice, mimicking his own words as he said “you cannot engage in politics without knowledge of mathematics.” The witness gallery laughed in unison at the display of judicial theatre. \n\nShortly thereafter the judges retired briefly for deliberations. There was to be no defence, of course. All that needed to be said had been said. Minutes past, and the judges emerged once more to announce their verdict. \n\n“Comrades! The court is ready to announce our verdicts. For Gumilyov, the court looks very negatively upon his subversive political activities, his denial of Russian nationhood, his organisation of extremism and his promotion of a culture of fear. We have sentenced him to death!” The judge announced with a disturbing smile, as he turned the page of his notes. “Ah! But because of his psychological health, he will instead be taken to a psychiatric facility, in the hope that he will in time come to his senses and face the gravity of what he has done!”\n\nThe crowd looked cheated and dejected at the death they were denied. Gumilyov, for his part, was none the wiser, having been dragged from the room faster than the judge could speak. \n\n“Shaferevich!” announced the judge, “For your political activities, your complicity with Gumilyov and your organisation of violent crimes against the state, we sentence you to 20 years in prison with hard labour. This sentence is however reduced to 10 years for good behavior at the regent’s behest, in recognition of your contribution to mathematics. Now get out of my court!”\n\nThe witnesses began to discuss the sentences amongst themselves. Why put Gumilyov in a straightjacket if you could simply be shot? He was the epicentre of it all, and he surely deserved to die for it. The regent’s mercy was inconsistent and erratic, though none dared to say so within his earshot. Its leaders may yet live, but the Passionary Party has finally been buried."

When the Tsar was toppled and the Bolsheviks seized the apparatus of state, they set up a finely spun web of councils and authorities that placed government far closer to the people, where it belonged. Power, once concentrated in the hands of an aloof and ill-informed despot, was now exercised by popular mandate, and proved far more responsive to the needs of ordinary Russians. Yet, with morally bankrupt visionaries at the top, the new Soviet system could not help but be steered onto the rocks, contrary to the wishes of the people. It was in balance, then, that Russia would prosper. The Tsars who ruled for centuries brought strength and tenacity, and the soviets of the people brought passion and vitality. This was the only way forward.\n\nDespite their errors, the communists and their beliefs still retained considerable support amongst the general population. Although Bukharin suffered a crushing defeat in the Great Patriotic War, many still cheer his name and lament his absence from the government of Russia. Bukharin had, after all, liberated many Russians from the chains of autocracy and propelled the motherland towards modernity. His brothers in arms stayed true to the cause even today, carving out their own homelands in Tyumen, on Lake Baikal and even in Central Siberia. Most notably, of course, they remained in Arkhangelsk. \n\nAlas, even the most militaristic and ideologically flexible Bolsheviks cannot be reasoned with. They have no desire for a Tsar, and they scoff at the very notion of a people’s monarch. The reds, in their ideological fervour, still see us as little more than pawns of Vyatka, and expect us to bring about a reactionary restoration. Of course, they also remember fighting against us during the West Russian War, and decry us as traitors and collaborators as a result - no better than the dogs of Samara.\n\nThe WRRF is no doubt fuming at our continued success, and carefully scrutinising battle plans for an imminent offensive against us. We must strike now, before they have a chance to gather their forces for an offensive. Perhaps in another time and another place they could have been reasoned with, but this is not the time for reason. This is the time for war."

Just as we did in Vyatka, we must attract such generals to our side, lest their talent be wasted. \n\nBelozersky sent letters to internment camps and prisons where senior Front officers had been detained, setting out a standard proposal for each general to pledge loyalty to the Mladorossi. Many of them, as was to be expected, refused to break faith with their defeated cause or pledge loyalty to their great enemy Kazem-Bek. It amused us to ask why they made such a foolish decision. Many said they did not like the idea of a Tsar in any form, making colourful remarks about the Romanovs and their tyranny, whereas others pointed to the damage wrought to the motherland by extremists and contrasted it to alleged stability under Bukharin. Even though we brought Vyatka to its knees and tore the last Romanov from his throne, they still cannot believe in the justice and provenance of our cause. \n\nBelozersky reported his findings to Kazem-Bek. The regent, who had found himself in a merciful mood that morning, decided to announce an amnesty for the generals, commanders and soldiers of the Revolutionary Front in exchange for the cessation of any insurgent activity against Berezniki. They could opt for a peaceful life, or serve the motherland once more in the armed forces, but in no case should they ever take arms against us.

But then, taught by bitter experience, the clerks still got involved in the work and were able to continue to work effectively.\n\nAfter all, Kazakh scribes note that the new standards of writing documents, as it seems to them, are more convenient to use than what was before.

The journey did not take too much time, but it was decent, since the distances between the cities are large.\n\nThe tsar's impressions were not overshadowed by any incidents, however, the journey itself... Left some mixed feelings. Firstly, he liked the very existence of the railway, and the way it was done very efficiently. Secondly, when visiting cities, he was glad that the population greeted him joyfully, although not as a triumphant. The population, however, thanked him and all the authorities for bringing to Kazakhstan many benefits of civilizations that had gone into desolation before them. Thirdly, the work of administrations, factories, entertainment centers and everything else that should give the ordinary citizen the greatest convenience in life was reviewed and checked. And the condition of many cities satisfied the wishes of the tsar himself.\n\nBut there are also negative aspects. The tsar was not satisfied with the fact that the territories between the cities are still in desolation. A lot of things are either not processed or not used, and the distances between large cities themselves are very large, which generally does not please Sergey. These territories, according to the tsar, should be inhabited by as many people as possible, but nothing has been done for this. Perhaps it will all be fixed over time, but the fact remains.\n\nIt is worth noting that Kazem-bek and Belozersky talked a lot on various business topics and just about life during the trip. We discussed the same Kazakhstan, what difficulties there were in creating all these conditions and other things. Kazem-bek, and perhaps Tsar Sergei Belozersky himself, could relax from hard work for the first time in such a long time.\n\nAfter traveling around Kazakhstan, the tsarist delegation, already together with the Prime Minister, wished to go back to the capital, already together by plane."

Our victory shows the value of our wise leadership and the heroism of our youths, and the major steps we have taken to an orderly and united Russia show the righteousness of our cause for all to see. \n\now that the European part of Russia is unified, we must consider the future of the state.

  berez_zemsob.1.d:0 "Kazem-Bek and Belozersky were together in the regent’s office, enjoying fine cigars and contemplating the remarkable chain of events that had seen Berezniki arise from obscurity to be the sole authority in Western Russia. Having once been a small state of scattered towns and villages, the Mladorossi state had toppled powerful enemies who by any reasonable estimation should have toppled the country in no time at all. Either the Lord God himself, luck, or simply careful calculation helped Berezniki survive the carnage of the Russian anarchy and subdue its many rivals. \n\nKazem-Bek’s happiness at his great triumph had been evident for all to see. He was recently notified that the last pocket of Bolshevik resistance had been stamped out in the far reaches of the Arctic coast, leaving no credible resistance to the Young Russians in the region. Order had been restored across the country, and the people no longer lived in fear of ideological fanatics or rampant banditry. Moreover, the triumph of the Mladorossi was achieved in a remarkably short period of time, sparing the Russian people to horrors of protracted war. \n\nBelozersky thought over the developments carefully before adding his thoughts, “As glad as I am that we’ve united Russia under our flag, the important question still remains - what next?”\n\nKazem-Bek nodded politely and replied, “Our task right now should be to consolidate power. If you remember, Sergei, after the unification we agreed to convene a Zemsky Sobor - an assembly of the land - to resolve issues regarding who should be the permanent head of state. Everyone knows that I am only a regent, and I cannot govern a united Russia myself. As you can imagine, we must prepare the country for the election of a new ruler, and doing so will be our next step.”\n\n“And you told me at the time that you wanted to nominate me to the throne - do you still want to?”\n\n“Of course, Sergei. In the meantime I have considered another potential candidate for the throne - Maria Romanova. She is not old enough to rule the country, so if the people choose her I will be forced to remain as regent for a time, although not forever. I thought it wise to present the people with a clear choice to avoid the perception that the monarch was illegitimate.”\n\nBelozersky nodded. “You say that Western Russia is united, but what about Onega? They claim to be the vanguard against communism, but with Bolshevism defeated it is abundantly clear that they only exist to serve the Finns, and our security surely depends on tearing it away from Finland’s hands. The men remain eager to fight, and would gladly follow any order to retake it.”\n\n“We must stress the importance of patience,” replied Kazem-Bek, “Onega will wait - the statelet will not go anywhere, and presents no direct danger to us at the moment. The consequences of provoking Finland before we have secured our state could be severe. Our task now is to organise a coronation.”\n\n“Of course, Alexander Lvovich.”\n\nFor another hour, the two men discussed their lives and pondered the future politics of the state, hoping with all their hearts that the Mladorossi ideal would long outlive them and their descendants."

It is likewise important to select a capital that is sufficiently prestigious for our enlarged country. \n\nThe question of having a suitable capital will be especially important if we want to hold elections to the throne through the Zemsky Sobor. The elections should be held in a suitable venue, and should be located in an area that is more accessible to delegates travelling from distant parts of the country. Besides  having a good capital will ease our everyday administrative problems too."

Thanks to our valiant efforts, we managed to turn Berezniki from half ruins into a prosperous city with industry and a fairly strong economy. \n\nSadly, the need to relocate the capital from Berezniki to a larger metropolis has been talked about for a long time. In the Mladorossi Russia, united under the single banner of Berezniki, many people feel that the old capital has outgrown its usefulness. Even though this was the city that formed the beating heart of our campaign to subdue the warlords, it is clear that it is increasingly a hindrance to governance in peacetime. A larger and more prestigious capital is needed - one that has room to grow and build, and has the population necessary to staff and maintain the institutions of government needed to establish ourselves as a sovereign state on the international stage. Everyone knows the names of world capitals such as Berlin, Moscow, London, Washington and others - and we need to acquire a city that will be similarly renowned worldwide. Against such competitors, the valiant little city of Berezniki seems insignificant in comparison. \n\nThe time has come to plan our move to a new capital. It must be a place in which we can establish a larger administrative hub, and develop our economy without hindrance. Among all the cities that exist in Western Russia, the suitable options seem to be limited to only Syktyvkar - the capital of the former Komi Republic - and Vyatka - the capital of the former Tsar Vladimir III. Both cities are equally suited to the role of capital - the ultimate decision seems to be more sentimental and cosmetic than practical.

Just as the election of Michael I saw the end of a period of foreign domination, the election of our own Tsar will signal an age where Russia can once more cast off foreign rule and unite the people behind a strong and noble leader.

Even in a peaceful environment, the regent was still called upon to solve hundreds of issues of various sizes. Yet, the biggest issue of all remained the question of the Zemsky Sobor. \n\nThe Regent had already determined the location of the Zemsky Sobor, but he had yet to properly consider the manner by which the delegates themselves would be selected. This question was by no means a trivial one - there are many power blocs in the new state that rightfully expect some manner of influence on the choice. Of course, it was the military who united Russia under the Mladorossi banner, and their voice must be heard. There are likewise many strong industrialists who control countless factories, and already exert a great deal of influence on government. Likewise, the Young Russian Party itself would never be content to sit on the sidelines, and its opinion should also be taken into account. Lastly the people, who are the natural source of political power, should not be deprived of a voice either. \n\nKazem-Bek had already finished a rough plan for the structure of the upcoming Zemsky Sobor. Moreover, Alexander Lvovich was inspired by the principles of the council convened at the end of the Time of Troubles in 1613, when the fate of the country as a whole was being decided. He wanted the new council to acknowledge and reflect the strengths of the old, whilst updating its composition and objectives to the realities of the 20th Century.\n\nAfter reflection, Kazem-Bek decided that the council itself should consist of 200 delegates. The first 100 delegates would be representatives of the people. The people would vote for their representatives according to a majoritarian system of election, and their representatives would reflect the interests of various districts. The remaining 100 people would be representatives of the military, industrialists and prominent party leaders, who through their own personal judgement would decide which prospective ruler to vote for. These interest groups of society would become a replacement for the outdated concept of Boyars, and the four groups of electors together amounted to the four modern estates of society. These 200 people would have to converge around only one candidate, and their choice would seal the fate of Russia for generations."

  berez_zemsob.4.t:0 "Candidate: Sergey Belozersky"
  berez_zemsob.4.d:0 "The very first candidate for the Russian throne is Sergey Belozersky. He is an old friend of Kazem-Bek, having known him since before the Great Patriotic War. He is indeed a good candidate for the Russian throne, and has clear and provable descent from the Rurikovich line. Belozersky is 19 generations removed from their line, and the connection itself provides him with a pedigree that most other men lack. \n\nSergey is also a very experienced commander. During the First World War, he showed himself as a good manager, being the staff-captain of the Horse Life Guards. A little later, he joined Yudenich’s army as a chief of staff of the II corps. After the civil war, he left for the United States and began serving there as an Air Force major, and after the fall of the USSR and the defeat of the West Russian Front, he returned to Berezniki. \n\nDespite a fairly rich military background and a closeness to royal blood, he was nevertheless viewed as a rather mediocre figure - that is until recently.\n\nWith the beginning of the “Battle for Western Russia”, he gained quite serious influence among the military elite, having established himself as an extremely outstanding leader and commander. His divisions, if not adored, came to be at least respected for the fact that he himself did a lot to win this battle for Russia. Indeed, the people themselves, who witnessed the ascent of the Young Russians, observe that this all happened not so much at the will of Kazem-Bek alone, but was done thanks to the efforts of Sergei Belozersky.\n\nBelozersky is respected not only by the common people, but the party as well. He is one of the old members of the Mladorossi, and within the organisation he has been able to secure good connections and centres of support.\n\nFinally, he may have a very strong chance of winning votes from the economic elites that own the military-industrial complex. These industrialists see an excellent opportunity in Belozersky to make additional money, and will therefore be inclined to lend him their support.\n\nIn general, if we weigh up the circumstances in Belozersky’s favour, it would be fair to assume that he will shortly become the ruler of Western Russia at the invitation of the Zemsky Sobor."

  berez_zemsob.5.d:0 "Maria Romanova, who is now only 10 years old, has serious rights to the Russian throne. She is a princess of the Romanov family, which was overthrown about half a century ago. No matter how strange it may sound, the mention of the Romanovs among the ordinary population has recently evoked, if not nostalgic feelings, at least a degree of honour and respect. During Bukharin’s time, a serious campaign was carried out to slander the name of the Romanovs, but it was not effective enough to permanently tarnish their legacy. Even the fact that Vladimir III was an actual Nazi collaborator evokes far from unambigious feelings among the population. \n\nMaria, despite her young age, can technically claim the Russian throne. But she will not be able to rule alone, because no child could ever reasonably be entrusted with such a duty. If you were to briefly assess her prospects, you might get the impression that she has a better chance than Belozersky. It is clear however that her young age will count significantly against her - the prospect of a continued regency until Maria reaches her majority is unpalatable to many. \n\nThere is a solution that would make life much easier. Kazem-Bek is already a regent, but he can continue in his role in the service of Maria and serve as the centre of power in the state. Of course, if Kazem-Bek is nominated as Maria’s regent, then the people would be voting not so much for Maria, but for Alexander Lvovich. Kazem-Bek is very popular among ordinary people, since he united much of Russia - although obviously not without the help of Belozersky. Among the people, it is believed that Kazem-Bek developed the strategies that led to victory, and that Belozersky merely put them into practice. It is no surprise, therefore, that many people should continue to rule the country in some capacity. Many fear that a premature transfer of power could deprive Russia of competent leadership, once again exposing Russia to the devastation of civil war. \n\nThis state of affairs, of course, will likely please Kazem-Bek, who may not want to leave politics so quickly after all that he has done. This proposed “coalition” of Maria-Bek has great potential, but it is worth remembering that Kazem-Bek may only rule so long as Maria is a child, and cannot rule alone. What will happen after that is anyone’s guess."

  berez_zemsob.6.d:0 "Kazem-Bek read an article in the newspaper some time ago. He still retained it in his archive, but evidently little of what the paper contained had any relevance to life today. Whilst it wasn’t exactly “news”, he had retained the paper for a single story that had taken his interest - the front page report that alleged the Komi politician Alexei Kosygin was in fact Alexei Romanov in disguise. Although sensationalist, Kazem-Bek felt it prudent to retain the article in case he needed to refer to it in the future - and that moment had come.\n\nAlexei Kosygin had, through chance and good fortune, secured another chance for his political career in the Mladorossi party. In fact, he had come to work in Berezniki itself, working under the close supervision of party loyalists as he shared his expertise. Kosygin, having finished his work for the day, came to Kazem-Bek’s office at exactly the appointed time. Greetings were exchanged, and Kosygin sat down at the table. Kazem-Bek, after a final look at the newspaper, put it down between them and spoke.\n\n“Why did you come?” \n\n“The Zemsky Sobor is at stake, and the main candidates are already known. Of course, I sincerely believe in the success of the Zemsky Sobor, but what if something unexpected happens?”\n\n“For example?” Kazem-Bek asked curiously.\n\n“Let’s say there are equal votes between Maria and Sergey...” answered Kosygin.\n\n“Do you seriously think that’s a likely prospect?”\n\nKosygin nodded. “Well, consider that Belozerksy is quite popular among the people, but Maria might appeal to many to enable you to rule the country for longer - granting the two candidacies equal levels of popular support. What if the people struggle to decide? Popular opinion does not always provide for decisive outcomes - as I have seen many times before in the Republic.”\n\nAfter a little pause and having glanced at the newspaper in front of Kazem-Bek, he set out his plan, “I could become a new candidate for the Russian throne. I am fully aware of the claims made about my identity, and I believe I can provide enough evidence to substantiate my rights to the throne as Alexei Romanov.”\n\nKazem-Bek looked bemused. “In all honesty, I can offer you the opportunity to become a unity candidate in the event that votes are distributed evenly between Romanova and Belozersky. That is, you will be a figure who will either attract votes in a second ballot and allow one of the others to win, or you will be elected yourself and become a ruler who can consolidate support.”\n\nKosygin looked surprised, “So you agree? I will have the opportunity to become a candidate?”\n\nKazem-Bek looked closely at the paper as he replied, “Yes, it seems like it might be necessary. But the only thing that supports your legitimacy is this newspaper, and whispered rumours. Yet I think under certain conditions the people can be led to believe that you are indeed a Romanov.”\n\nThe path to victory for Kosygin was narrow, but he had clearly made a significant breakthrough. If he gained power, the destiny of Russia could change dramatically. He could only hope and pray that the Zemsky Sobor could not decide on anyone else.\n\nA little later, Kosygin asked Kazem-Bek another question, “Why are you so worried about the result of the Zemsky Sobor, anyway? Why can’t you just continue to rule alone?”\n\n“I myself, perhaps, would like to rule the country, but I have already discharged my original role - to prepare the country for a future King or Queen. I am the regent, and announced myself as such to the whole world, and I cannot officially usurp power, nor can I change the fact that our ideology presupposes the existence of a King. I cannot become a king because, although I am of noble blood, there are those who are more worthy to become a monarch.”\n\nKazem-Bek had spoken."

Despite the fall of their republic, Kosygin has already managed to recover and rebuild his influence, becoming a prominent new figure within the Mladorossi. His influence within our party has been reinforced by his earlier achievements, and embellished with tireless work to improve and consolidate the system we have built. \n\nKosygin amazed people with his outstanding mathematical abilities from birth. Multiplying large numbers in his head, he could solve problems in seconds that would take other people minutes or hours to work out. He was clearly the smartest among his peers. After the revolution, he began to manage a cooperative in Novosibirsk and earned as much money as one could safely earn within the new socialist system. His cooperative was one of the few profitable ones, amidst a general picture of economic stagnation in Bukharin’s time. Later in his pre-war career he came to manage the textile factory in Leningrad, and after the USSR’s defeat he ended up in Komi, where the democratic regime was eventually established.\n\nJust recently a rumour has begun to circulate that Kosygin is none other than Alexei Romanov, who miraculously survived the night of July 16th, 1918. The newspaper that first put the claims into print in Komi caused some sensation, providing some fairly compelling evidence in favour of the incredible claim. Supporters of the theory draw attention to fairly close facial features, and point further to similar character traits and intellect said to have been exhibited by the missing prince. With this established, it was claimed that Alexei Romanov became the adopted son of Bukharin and given a new history and surname. Kosygin’s unusual wealth and power during the time of Soviet rule were often cited as a reason why his publicly available biography was in fact a deception.\n\nevertheless, the wider public have remained very sceptical of this theory, with many considering it to be an absurd joke or a delusion of the reactionary class. Despite the incredulity of the people, Kazem-Bek has considered the claims sufficient reason to allow him to become a candidate for the Russian throne, so as to allow the Zemsky Sobor to decide on his merits and claim.n\nHis chances of becoming ruler are very slim. Kosygin, whoever he really is, is still known widely only as a Soviet bureaucrat and liberal leader, and the claims regarding his true identity were largely confined to the Komi Republic. It is known that Kosygin continues to be very close to the common people and still upholds democratic and egalitarian principles, a persona rather far removed from the popular history of the Romanov family. His power - if he were somehow to be elected - will be founded upon very little legitimacy, since it would take some time to convince the majority of his claims to the throne. For similar reasons, the military hierarchy and intelligentsia have grave reservations about his suitability to rule. His only pre-existing base of support comes from the industrialists, who hope for looser state regulation of the economy - although the majority still lean towards Belozersky."

Father from daughter, wife and husband? You finally invited me here to see Maria again - so what dark twist will there be?”\n\nKazem-Bek silently pushed out a chair and beckoned Leonid to sit, whilst Maria retreated behind a cabinet at the back of the room, realising that the topic at hand was one of great seriousness. \n\n“Make no mistake,” said Kazem-Bek sternly, “I will gladly give you chances to meet, but I am firm in my view that Maria must be raised to uphold the values she was born to protect. She must be sensitive to the problems of the people, help them, stand alongside them and be fair to them. Those are the values of a King, or indeed of a Queen! I am sorry to say that you are a “destructive” influence on your daughter. She is not yet attuned with the ideology of state, and your own views will drive her back into the retrograde thinking of a bygone era. Maria has the capability to become a great Empress, if not the greatest! It is she who must save Russia, and save all people on this broken earth. I will do everything I must to see this dream accomplished, whatever the price!”\n\nMaria had listened attentively to Kazem-Bek. Despite her young age, she comprehended the meaning of every word and nuance. She was certainly displeased that Uncle Sasha was stopping her from living with her family, and yet she knew something that the regent did not. She knew far more of her father’s dark ties to Germany, not only as a collaborator, but as an instrument of far more sinister influences from the Burgundian black state that lurked in the darkest shadows of Vyatka. Though truly a good and kind person, his daughter was nevertheless able to recognise a streak of megalomania and moral flexibility that could well have taken Russia into a bleak future.\n\nLeonid, for her part, was shaken by what Kazem-Bek said. She could protest, but she could not reverse the decision of the regent. She had only one request:\n\n“Please, if Maria is not indeed chosen, then let her return to us.”\n\n“I promise she will return to you, if that is the people’s wish.” Kazem-Bek replied dismissively, beckoning Leonid from the room. \n\nAlone together once more, Maria asked her own question of the regent, “And you really think I will become the greatest Empress, like you told mother?”\n\n“Yes, this right is given to you by God.

He finally had his well deserved day off, which he hoped to enjoy thoroughly. Dressed in a brown jacket and elegant black trousers, he went out to explore the city. Yet, to his surprise, he saw big crowds of people winding through the streets to the city centre. Why would so many gather in one place? His interest perked, Vasily mingled into the crowd and followed it through the streets, smoking one of his precious fine cigars as he went. \n\nAs he approached the city centre, he saw what looked like a street fair, where all the people had gathered. Vasily stopped one stranger to inquire, “Sorry, but what’s going on? What is all this turmoil?”\n\n“You didn’t know, young man? Maria Vladimirovna has organised for us, the common people, a generous supply of food, clothing and goods for us to...” the old man paused to reconsider his words, “Maria and Kazem-Bek, that is!” \n\nThe old man dived back into the crowd before Vasily could get another word in. Of course, the crazy Kazem-Bek, he thought. He always knew that the so-called regent cared little for ordinary people, and this did not prove otherwise. His old icon Kosygin might have been fooled, but Vasily was not. This “distribution”, a simple act of bribery, was a mockery to the people. He called himself a regent, and yet he was simply an aloof King, seeking to rule by proxy through a princess who not yet old enough to govern. Kazem-Bek’s exact plan might be unknown, but his desire to rule was clear for all to see. \n\nVasily approached the so-called “distribution”, where young girls distributed black and white bread with a rich chicken soup. Vasily took his share and had a taste. It might not be a true taste of democracy, but perhaps bread and circuses were not so bad after all?"

If fancy suits and bowties made self-important men more comfortable, then so be it. They had all been gathered to meet Maria, who had for her part been dressed in all the trappings of royalty.

Although the generals were loyal allies, comrades and friends, it was on this occasion that most of them formed a discrete opposition within the apparatus of state. Many generals considered the election unnecessary, and in any event would surely throw their support behind Belozersky. Many in his camp had expected little opposition, but Maria’s campaign had offered them fierce resistance. \n\nMaria Vladimirovna herself had appeared before the assembled guests of the uppermost echelons of society. She wore an ivory coloured dress with open neck and shoulders, and wore white gloves, with her hair in a charming but modest style. With regal grace, Mary descended from the balcony to the hall, as though an angel in transit from heaven to the earth. Having made her way down the steps, she welcomed the assembled guests and mingled among them. She began to talk to everyone about everything they desired, and it was easy to forget that she was merely a child of a tender age. The expressions of the people told a clear story - the men of West Russia were very pleased with the princess they had come to know. \n\nHours passed at the ball. Some guests had slipped away, but others, swelling with the rich meals they had consumed, sat dazed at their tables fighting off the will to sleep. More still were away from the tables, dancing energetically amongst themselves. Men and women paired off in turn to dance together, and Maria with her simple, light and refined movements interested everyone - the gentleman in turn led her elegantly around the room for as long as they could justify remaining with her. So the waltz continued, into the gloom of the night.\n\nWhen the hall had finally emptied, Maria found herself in the midst of Kazem-Bek and his loyal generals. She smirked at Kazem-Bek’s characteristically grumpy face.\n\n“Well, Uncle Sasha, did you not like the ball? After all, I think you know as well as I do that I was merely acting my part. It disgusts me a little to pretend to like all of those so-called gentlemen, but they believed me all the same. I think they will vote for me and hand over the money we need to win!”\n\n“Ah... yes... Maria, or rather, your Highness. Perhaps I felt more uncomfortable with the situation than you did, in the end. You did well!” Kazem-Bek patted Maria a little on the shoulder.\n\nMaria smiled as she walked quickly up the stairs, “Then please excuse me Uncle, Generals, because I need to take off this damned dress before I finally choke to death!” \n\n“Are you worried about something, regent?” Ardashev murmured as she passed out of earshot.\n\n“Yes and no...

Party members had already voiced their dissatisfaction with his choice of candidate - pointing angrily at Maria’s German collaborator father and her increasingly isolated upbringing in Kazem-Bek’s dacha in the woods.

Instead, word had reached them at the last moment of Kazem-Bek’s arrival, and of the young princess Maria he had brought along with him. The room throbbed with silent anticipation.\n\nThe unmarked car came to a halt at the entrance to the Regency Council building. Kazem-Bek jumped out quickly, meandering around the car to open the door for the princess, as though a moment’s hesitation in assisting her could have placed her in some unknown peril. Maria for her part was clearly nervous - she was expected to give a bold and poetic speech that Kazem-Bek had written for her to impress and flatter the party rank and file, but she had barely learned a third of it. She had little choice but to improvise, lest she be caught fumbling her words at a crucial moment.\n\nThe guests were greeted with polite applause, and Kazem-Bek motioned Maria gently to the stage as he took his seat with the senior generals in the front row of the auditorium. Maria, a young girl not yet even in her teenage years, now faced down the party members responsible for the entire apparatus of state! Mindful of the enormity of her task, Maria pulled herself together and began to speak.\n\n“Greetings to all of you, fellow Young Russians! You will all have heard of me, Maria Vladimirovna, as a candidate for the Russian throne and as the daughter of the German collaborator Vladimir III. But those words alone do not accurately describe the kind of person that I am. Do you see in me an ordinary simpleton who will lead us into the abyss? These cynical lies are whispered all across West Russia, but not by anyone who has had the opportunity to meet me! I am a Young Russian in the purest sense, matured by hardship and raised to believe in the ideals of this party! Russia needs a just Tsar, one who will not muddle the objectives of the Mladarossi with their own personal agenda. I am not just a silly underage girl - I am the candidate best equipped to bring forward our great idea, and sit comfortably in the monarch’s laurels. I will give my soul and my life to the Motherland and the Russian people!\n\nKazem-Bek groaned. That was not quite the speech he had prepared. He gazed nervously around the room as he waited for a reaction from the crowd. However, after brief murmurs, the party faithful gradually broke into applause. Perhaps they saw in her a will and courage that Kazem-Bek could not have expressed with mere words on a page. A pleasant surprise. When Maria came down from the stage and ran towards the regent, she was quick to apologise for going off script. Kazem-Bek simply stroked her on the head and congratulated her on her first speech.\n\n“You will have a bright future indeed!”"

He is not a candidate “of the people”, although many sensible and forward thinking voters are nevertheless eager to support him as Tsar. The support afforded to Belozersky from the wealthy and well-connected people of the country has also proven extremely valuable in disseminating our message in ways that simple manpower would not permit. There are of course plenty of ways in which we can defeat the so-called Maria-Bek coalition, but our counter-campaigns have served simply to turn the election into a stalemate. Perhaps the people are more eager to see Kazem-Bek’s continued rule through a puppet than to actually gain a strong Tsar that the Mladarossi ideal calls for. \n\n“Sergey Sergeevich!” came a voice from the doorway, as Belozersky’s personal secretary stepped into the room.\n\n“What’s to report, my friend?” Belozersky replied.\n\n“I have urgent news,” replied the secretary with an ashen face, “Alexei Kosygin has been announced as a third candidate, and he is now claiming to be the lost Tsarevich himself!”\n\nBelozersky looked at the man with a blank stare. “What the actual fuck? Are we really going to have to fight a two front campaign against a little girl and a man who has returned from the grave?”\n\nThe secretary sighed. “It would seem so, although our campaign plan won’t need to change too dramatically to accommodate it. It just means we can’t simply criticise Maria’s young age without promoting your own strengths.”\n\nBelozersky nodded. “I’ve come to the conclusion that we need to win the electorate back by promoting my experience and qualifications.

Any schoolboy or common citizen who picks up this leaflet should be able to understand what is being conveyed with ease. After trying out various different illustrations, they finally decided on an illustration that was simple enough to convey its message, but embellished enough to be eye-catching. Belozersky for his part was appreciative, and quickly approved the design for printing.\n\nBelozersky’s own talents need to be presented in an eye catching way as well. Inspired by the history of Russia, Belozersky has chosen to use Rurikid imagery with a modern twist. He is now the personification of his proud ancestors in the modern world, and in turn he will grant his country the prosperity it once enjoyed. Saint Vladimir, Yaroslav the Wise, Ivan III - these great men brought Russia into a golden age, and Sergei Belozersky-Rurikovich herald his own golden age in turn. Order and stability will once more be the defining character of the Russian nation.\n\nAlexei Kosygin “Romanov” has been leading his own election campaign as well, and it seems he has found to his frustration that his popular appeal has not so easily travelled out from the little city state he once made his home. Many liberally minded men and women have seen the merits of strong and stable leadership, and natural supporters of both Maria and Alexei alike have begun to drift into our camp.

The votes and financing of industrialists are very important for us to win. To ensure our victory, we need a backer who can sustain and develop our links with big business. Our man will not be just anyone, but Felix Yusupov himself, once one of the richest people in Russia, whose wealth was second only to that of the Imperial Romanov family. \n\nWe must invite him to the country and convince him to leverage his fame and connections to ensure that support from industry is as firm as it can be."

  berez_zemsob.15.d:0 "Genuine capitalists in Russia only began to reappear after we united the main territories in the west. Before that, money was an asset that played a far lesser role than simple barter, with money too vulnerable to price fluctuations and counterfeiting to be able to underpin any business. The end of the German terror bombing helped matters of course - suddenly businesses could rest easy in the knowledge that their beloved factory would not be a smoldering ruin when they returned to it the next morning. \n\nWhat we Russians call “capitalism” is naturally still nothing like the sea of dollar signs and financial complexity that American industry seems to float upon. If we want to strengthen our own private sector, we must work harder to emulate free market economies overseas and invite people of standing to promote capitalism to our own citizens. \n\nFelix Yusupov, who was once the richest man in the Russian Empire, does not have anywhere near the wealth he was forced to abandon in the wake of the revolution. He does not possess financial power as much as he possesses connections and moral gravitas - his fame has afforded him good connections with industrialists, returning white emigres and many more in the new elite, each of whom can provide capital that we so desperately need. We must try to convince him to return and spend his twilight years in his homeland - and implore him to bring as many of his compatriots with him as possible. \n\nBelozersky was quick to draft his letter to Yusupov, and it made its way to the United States along the fledgling mail routes that had quickly sprung up to connect the West Russian state the outside world. His letter found a sympathetic reader, and after quick deliberation the old man resolved to return to his homeland, taking a short few weeks to implore other emigres to follow. The comforts of American life proved too great for some to abandon of course - but many other patriotic souls likewise drew up plans to return to Russia. Many others chose a middle path - with links Russia gradually opening up outside Germany’s reach, they looked to invest in the motherland and influence it from afar - perhaps tempted more by the allure of cheap Russian labour than any sense of patriotic duty. \n\nStill, a Russian doesn’t have to truly love his country to lend it a hand.

With units deployed along critical sections of our permeable border, the main question would be which units we can afford to bring home to participate. West Russia had just been united, but it was incumbent on our men in uniform to keep it so. For those units that could be spared, they would serve to execute the final gambit in Belozersky’s electoral stratagem. By displaying the discipline and might of the Young Russian army, Belozersky would be sure to impress many reticent people. What’s more, the added expenditure on the armed forces could only serve to shore up support even more, and the prestige of such an event would likewise reflect very well on the country as a whole!\n\nOnly the most reliable soldiers were recalled to the capital for the parade. Soldiers were selected not for their combat performance, but their ability to hold their rifle properly and to march as part of an infantry box. Several regiments were transferred, and the parade column came to number about 10,000 infantry in all. Of course, no modern army is complete without modern equipment, and many captured tanks and armoured vehicles were likewise pulled from warehouses to complement the marching column. The local airfield became abuzz with activity, as numerous aircraft were flown in from other airstations to form part of an aerial display. Awkwardly, Belozersky was forced to pass the final decision on the parade to Kazem-Bek, although it was clear that the regent could not possibly refuse to hold such an event despite the fact that it was so transparently a power play on the part of his general. \n\nBulletins were circulated across the city, announcing 10am as the start time of the event. The parade had been choreographed to ensure that the most battle hardened units would lead the column, followed by the best of their military equipment, much of which had never actually served the army in combat. The ground forces would be quickly followed by the air display, which would brighten the sky as the military band below play the old marches of the Soviet Union, their melodies still inspiring the men long after its fall. \n\nThe parade went on for about an hour and a half, with the men marching with passion and dignity, even if a few among them weren’t quite as good at marching in formation as we might have hoped. The infantry made their way back to barracks in advance of the tanks, from which flew the flag of the Young Russians, the old emblems of the Gorky Tank Brigade having been erased from the chassis of each vehicle just days before. The planes made a spectacular but brief appearance, their unmissable presence in the clear blue sky caught agonisingly short by the understandable requirement to conserve aviation fuel.\n\nThe spectators seemed impressed, for the most part. Many were more accustomed to seeing militia in mismatched uniform than professional soldiers marching in formation, and their enthusiasm for the new status quo was infectious.

In Komi his party had been able to flourish for no small part due to its close connection with popular causes, and his ability to deliver on the bread and butter issues that were so often ignored by political extremists on the left and right. He was however merely a big fish in a small pond. His reputation outside of the Komi Republic has proven rather minimal, and whilst people might have heard his name, they know little of the man himself. For those who doubt his claims of royal blood he is merely a charlatan, an imposter who has come to usurp the throne for his own unknowable ends. This perception needs to stop.\n\nAlexei Kosygin needs to declare himself to the whole of Western Russia as the surviving and legitimate heir of Nicholas II. To convincingly demonstrate his claim, he needs to do more than just appoint campaigners to canvass on his behalf. The Tsarevich must make his presence known in the homes of every Russian voter, introducing himself to them through constant appearances on radio, in the newspapers, and through the TV channels reaching those Russians now fortunate enough to own a television set. Information must flow faster than anyone is able to refute it, and Alexei Kosygin must deliver performance after performance to make a new name for himself as Alexei Romanov.\n\nSuccess will require close collaboration with media moguls. Kosygin therefore reached out to Georgy Sergeev - the owner of several of the television and radio stations in Berezniki, Artyom Konovalov - the owner of several newspaper publications, and Kirill Biryukov - the manager of magazines and other periodicals. From first contact followed a number of generous promises and financial incentives, and so began a fruitful partnership in which Kosygin was able to introduce himself properly to the people.\n\nWith Konovalov’s help, the Romanov prince was a frequent star of the newspaper front pages, complete with glowing reviews of his humanitarian work and his generosity towards the people. The papers were quick to report Kosygin’s donation of a tractor to an impoverished village, and the immediate benefits they enjoyed as they were able to use the tractor to improve irrigation channels across their land. His donation of several thousand rubles to a fund to help orphans of the past wars was also quickly reported, and from story to story it was ever clearer that Kosygin had gotten far more for his money than leaflets and posters could ever have done to place him in the public eye. \n\nKosygin made very good use of his appearance on the airwaves as well. His appearance as Georgy Sergeev’s guest on an edition of “Glas Rossii” saw him hailed as a special guest and his voice carried to the homes of countless loyal listeners. The Voice of Russia announcer asked gentle questions, granting Kosygin plenty of leeway to tell the story that he wanted to tell. To be asked if he was the adopted son of Bukharin himself was enough to make the straight talking Kosygin squirm in his seat, but he was fortunately able to regain his composure quickly enough to tell the tall tale that he had prepared, to Sergeev’s obvious satisfaction. Impossibilities became possibilities which morphed into reality, and the more that listeners heard the words of the Tsarevich, the fewer questions they had. At least for the moment. "

He imagined the old Tsar becoming incandescent with rage as he read the presumptuous words of an upjumped prole scrawled haphazardly across the sheet of paper before him. No matter - he could do no better than what he had already written, and he could only hope that Vladimir would be more reasonable than he feared.\n\n“Your Highness Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov!

You no doubt already know that I have put myself forward as a candidate in the forthcoming Zemsky Sobor, the outcome of which will reverberate through Russian history for generations to come. Alas, I do not really have the benefit of your family’s noble pedigree. I am not so foolish to attempt to convince you that I am truly the lost Tsarevich Alexei, but I hope you will come to understand the reasoning behind my deception.” \n\n“Like you, the nation I tried to build was culled in its infancy by the expansion of the Young Russian state. Despite this, the meandering course of history has provided me, and those who support me, with a new opportunity. It falls to us to work within the new system to build a Russia that is fair, and places the welfare of its people as its highest concern. There are many who are yet to be convinced, but with your help I believe we can win those who are currently too consumed with doubts towards my claimed heritage to lend me their support.”\n\n“Your Highness, I understand the pain you must feel for being separated from your daughter. If I win, I will ensure that she is returned to you without delay, and that your family is left in peace as an honoured junior branch of the royal family. It pains me to make such a presumptuous request of you, but if you can treat me as your own family, I will likewise treat you as mine.”\n\nPlacing the letter in the envelope, he asked the courier to take the letter to Vladimir himself, away from the watching eyes of government postal censors. It took only three days for the courier to return with a reply in hand, and much as Kosygin feared, the letter began with an angry tone. For shame, wrote Vladimir, that a turner’s son might declare himself royalty! As the letter continued, the indignation of its writer gradually turned, taking on a more diplomatic character. Although he had promised not to interfere in politics at all, Vladimir stressed that the thinly-veiled captivity of his daughter had eroded what little trust he could place in Kazem-Bek. Though it might demean him, he could not refuse an offer that would see his beloved child released back into his care. Kosygin was, at least on paper, anointed as a Romanov."

The “Every Man a Tsar” programme promised the people a guaranteed standard of living, promising an end to the grinding poverty that had typified the lives of ordinary Russians for so long. He promised the institution of out-of-work benefits, state pensions, minimum wages and the construction of public housing blocks to house anyone unable to find a place to rent. \n\nWhat was there to object to? The cost, of course. Somewhat surprisingly, Sergeev broke from his usual conciliatory tone to press Kosygin on the expense of all his proposals. If Russia could truly promote the well-being of every citizen, why couldn’t Bukharin’s own idealistic regime succeed where others had failed? \n\nKosygin nodded in affirmation.

Russia was rich in natural wealth and awash with manpower, but no central plan could ever be sufficient to ensure that every man and woman did their part to tap it all.

It was thanks to them that the Mladorossi state prevailed in the war for Western Russia, and beyond the cities and towns their continued presence is crucial to preserving order and avoiding the return of banditry. Their influence has been reflected as a separate electoral constituency for the military, with soldiers able to elect far more representatives than their actual numbers ought to entitle them to. It is to be expected that they would want to vote for someone offering them money and good conditions, and thus our primary opponent in this endeavour is Sergei Belozersky.\n\nBelozersky is not only respected and revered for his military service, but also respected for the huge amount of time he has devoted to promoting the interests of the armed forces within the state. He is ready to spend millions, if not billions of rubles to maintain the army in the highest possible state of readiness and secure the defence of Russia from all threats. Although Maria’s campaign has likewise made overtures to the armed forces, it is clear that has swung behind the candidate most aligned with their interests. \n\nIf we want to get at least some military electorate, then we must make an offer equivalent to Belozersky's expectations. Kosygin-Romanov, speaking on the next radio issue of the Glas Rossii, he talked about what he would do with the army. He talks about how much the army is needed in modern realities, and he comes to the conclusion that the army is needed especially in the current reality, because the enemies are still surrounding Western Russia. The presence of a strong army today is the guarantor of the independence of the state, and it is also it that can protect the welfare of citizens. After that, he came to the conclusion that country needs an army not  massive but modern and first-class. It must be ready for all cases in the war, skills will not be superfluous. But, in addition, it will have to have modern weapons, because the current weapons are already beginning to become obsolete. We need first-class weapons that will give us an advantage over the enemy for decades to come. Therefore, Kosygin-Romanov indicated that it would be necessary to develop new weapons, and if necessary, even from the category of super-weapons.\n\nThe military, after such a radio release, began to seriously think about voting not for Belozersky, but for Kosygin-Romanov. At least half of the military voters doubted Kosygin-Romanov's military plans, but the second part still thought that it was still worth voting for Alexey. As a result, there is a division of votes in this electorate for Belozersky and for Kosygin-Romanov."

During the day, polling stations will operate on the territory of Western Russia, which are located in large administrative buildings, factories and schools that were restored after the bombing of the Luftwaffe and the battles for a free part of Russia from the Nazis.\n\nThe reception of bills has begun at the voting points. To vote, it is enough to show any identity document. It can be either a passport, or a work record, even a student ID. In order to avoid election fraud or repeated delivery of the vote, they write directly in the document in an empty place that the person has already voted. This is not a clever way to protect yourself from such similar incidents.\n\nA worker who had just left the polling station was showing his workbook to his friend at work, where there was a painting on a free sheet that he had already voted. Now if he tries to go to another polling station, he will not be able to get there, because he will simply not be allowed in because of this signature.\n\nFor our administration today will be very difficult. It will be necessary to sort out a whole mountain of red tape once and collect information from all over the country. This has not happened, perhaps, since the time of Bukharin or even earlier – since the time of the Constituent Assembly. When information is collected on which regions wished to vote, the electors directly in the Zemsky Sobor will have to cast their vote in accordance with the wishes of the region. This procedure, however, is very long, and therefore we have only to wait for the election results."

Sergei Belozersky did not think that he could lose, because too much had been done to lose to one of the candidates. But the only thing that did not please him was the waiting time. It took too long to count the votes, and therefore even a fairly firm person like Belozersky began to wait tiresomely.\n\nFinally, closer to midnight they announced that the counting of votes had ended and it was possible to go to the hall where the candidate's victory would be announced. After 15 minutes, everyone was gathered in the hall and after that the jury from the Zemsky Sobor announced the voting results.\n\n121 votes – Sergey Belozersky\n\n 43 votes – Maria Romanova\n\n36 voices – Alexey Romanov.\n\nIt was announced that Sergey Belozersky won! Finally, after a long election campaign, it was possible to exhale calmly. Although it becomes immediately clear that after this Sergei will have more work, he is still glad that the people still elected him their tsar.\n\nKazem-bek with Maria and Alexey Kosygin-Romanov came to Sergey to congratulate him on his victory. Maria almost burst into tears from the fact that she did not become a Queen, to which Sergei and Kazem-bek quickly began to calm down and say that perhaps it was only for the best. Even without being a queen, you can be one. And yet, but now it is a fair accomplishment – Sergei Belozersky, the bearer of the Rurikovich blood, became the tsar of Western Russia."

For her, this moment was a matter of life and death. She has long set herself up to help people with her divine guidance. She has done a lot, but she is so afraid of failure. What will she do? If, for example, Belozersky wins? Or Kosygin-Romanov? She had a lot of questions, but so few answers.\n\nKazem-bek interrupted her thoughts: \n\n-Is everything okay? You're not looking good. Is it all because of the elections?  Kazem-bek asked her.\n\n-You're right, Uncle Sasha. I'm afraid of the future. If I win, then I will be entrusted with a huge responsibility and the hopes of the people, which I may not be able to realize... And if I lose, what will be my fate? What if they send me away from Russia with my father? Or am I just going to live out my life aimlessly in my father's small estate?  Maria was saying, almost bursting into tears.\n\n-The unknown is frightening, I agree with that, but you have me, your faithful assistant and comrade. I will help you adapt to this whole process, but I will also make sure that your soul does not harden. You will be a beautiful queen, I guarantee you that,\" Kazem-bek said, \n\n\"You have nothing to worry about. You have also impressed many electors with your frankness and kindness, which every queen should have. Moreover, I'll tell you a secret, - Kazem-bek took out a piece of paper on which there was a map of Western Russia. Districts were painted on it, - You won almost 70% of the electors in the elections, but we still don't know how the “elite electors” will decide. But I am sure that you will win, and the dreams of the Russian people will turn into reality!\n\nAfter Kazem-bek's words, Maria calmed down a little and waited for the turmoil to end and the voting to begin. \n\nInitially, the electors who were chosen by the people voted. The results were as follows: 68 votes for Maria Vladimirovna, 12 votes for Kosygin-Romanov and 20 votes for Beloozersky. \n\nThis decision was met with stormy applause from Maria's supporters and a negative reaction from the supporters of Beloozersky.

The minutes seemed long, although it was possible to embellish your expectation with lively conversations and snacks. Tellingly, Kosygin-Romanov did not drink alcohol, only water and juices, which looked very unusual among the elite who liked to drink champagne. A comfortable chair at one point of waiting began to seem not even comfortable at all, and at the same time I wanted to sleep, but I couldn't do it because of the heavy waiting.\n\nThere are 200 votes, but it was necessary to find out who is voting for whom.

But despite the policy aimed at improving the well-being of the citizens, in some regions there are still resistance cells that want to return to the system under which they lived.

The adviser asked.\n\n— Our first decree and our next step, respectively, my friend, will be the fulfillment of pre-election promises to the people. We promised to start developing the welfare of the people and now it's time to implement our idea.  Belozersky said with a certain tone of confidence.\n\n— Won't industrialists approve of such restrictions?  The adviser said with some disbelief. – After all, they are the ones who supported us at the Zemsky Sobor.\n\n— They didn't approve of us for that. In addition, our working conditions should not be critical for our nascent industry, and besides, they will not be very strong. Yes, we will lose productivity in factories in a certain sense, but workers are now suffering from overwork at their machines. The law that we issued before the Battle for Western Russia now applies to the whole of Western Russia, which should not work now, and at the moment there is no need for it. Therefore, we must resolve this issue.\n\n- As you say. I am ready to work with you.\n\nAfter a while, Belozersky carefully watched the ready-made decrees that his advisers had prepared. Many times he had to refuse certain decrees due to the dampness of their execution and demanded from his subordinates the introduction of clarifications and forced to polish every aspect of the issue to a shine. In the end, Belozersky finally said that these variants of the decree are worthy and can be published. Finally, he put a signature that will help increase the welfare of the population:"

Even the decree that we have issued is being implemented with great difficulties.\n\nDuring the era of warring generals on the territory of Western Russia, these same pseudo-leaders tried to create a semblance of a state. Any state, even one that can only formally claim the title of such, needs officials, and these militant generals have succeeded in this.

  berez_belozerski.2.d:0 "Despite the fact that we want to avoid the mistakes of 1917, we must understand that it is extremely undesirable for us to go to the other extreme. The power of the Tsar and the power of the people should complement each other, and not drag each other. It is quite obvious that if we create a parliament, it will weaken the position of the official authorities. However, we cannot do without it, because we will repeat the mistake of Tsar Nicholas II. Therefore, we need to make the process of creating parties in Parliament difficult. If necessary, very difficult.\n\nSo it was decided to prepare the creation of the parliament. Belozersky asked his Prime Minister Kazem-bek to start preparing the reform of the creation of the parliament. This is a difficult task that should be entrusted only to an experienced politician. No matter how strange it may sound, but Kazem-bek did not have to work for a long time, since he already had some blanks initially. He himself understands the necessity and the danger of parliament as such, and therefore he immediately made a bill.\n\nAccording to Kazem-bek's project, the parliament should be called the Supreme Council, consisting of 1,000 people, among whom 750 people should be representatives of the Mladorossi. The remaining 250 people are people who represent other political parties in the country. Moreover, political parties should be created in accordance with the law, which will be published in parallel with the law on the Supreme Council. According to the plan, in order to create a batch, it is necessary to fulfill a number of requirements, of which there are about 20 pieces. This will certainly complicate the task of creating a party that will be against the  Mladorossi.\n\nThe existence of such requirements will eventually lead to the creation of parties in the country that will be subordinate to the state. The presence of such parties will create the illusion of choice among citizens, when in fact there is none. Everything has already been decided.\n\nKazem-bek outlined the rights and duties of the Supreme Council. This authority can veto the laws of the Tsar, can itself put forward laws to Belozersky, propose ministers to the Tsar, and so on. But this is not enough. Kazem-bek proposed an option where Belozersky, in the event of a crisis of power, would have the opportunity to take power into his own hands and completely.\n\nBelozersky has already said his word. He knew who to entrust such an important job to, and he signed this bill with his \"approved\"."

Nonetheless these councils were extremely politicized and couldn’t act on their own, without the help of the state, which led to the economic collapse of the USSR. We need to account for this mistake and create new soviets that adhere to Mladorossi ideology. \n\nBut, even this matter can’t be solved so simply. There are some, who won’t appreciate the creation of these councils and can’t stand the term “soviet”. That’s why we need to find a way to create them in such a way that the people welcome them with open arms."
  berez_belozerski.3.t:0 "The New Soviets"
  berez_belozerski.3.d:0 "To create truly Mladorossistate, the next item is the creation of soviets. Councils are supposed to solve problems of a local nature, and they will be able to do this as long as they do not encounter a problem outside their competence. Our territories are vast and need additional reform to reduce administrative pressure on our state apparatus. In addition, we need this to create a constitutional people's monarchy, and in order to create a parliament, we need some kind of specific base – and this base will be found among these very councils.\n\nWe could simply introduce soviets, but there are certain difficulties with this. There is a whole group of people in the country who are ardent anti-communists, conservatives and reactionaries who do not tolerate this word. In their opinion, there should be no councils, or at best they should be very limited. Of course, there are few such people, but they do not understand that we will have other advice.\n\nBelozersky instructed Kazem-bek to start work on the bill, and he almost the next day provided a draft for the establishment of councils. They say that the Councils will be accountable to the population. This means that citizens will have the right to change their deputy if he does not satisfy their requests. The Councils are composed of citizens who are directly employed in production, that is, performing public and state duties along with their production activities. The status of a deputy is not a profession, but rather a related position. Elected officials who are separated from production are assigned a salary no higher than the average salary of a worker.\n\nThe whole plan seemed very compromising. However, Belozersky asked a question about the Councils that will form the Supreme Council. Who will be included there by party composition? Kazem-bek said without thinking twice that the soviets would have to consist of at least 2/3 of ruling party members, and in accordance with the laws on party registration, we can control the opposition. This way we will not lose the power and legitimacy of our government.\n\nBelozersky still decided to sign a version of the plan. It seems to be a compromise for all groups of the population, since everyone can be elected to the councils, but at the same time only those who have the right to vote – deputies from the council, and thus it turns out that we can satisfy the interests of both the people and reactionary groups."

First of all, this is characteristic of such regimes that have recently come to power and are trying to establish a solid foundation for their legitimacy – the support of the population. Unfortunately, there are many in our country who believe that it was better under Nicholas II than even now. This is partly true, but their blind faith in the now deceased Tsar undermines our legitimacy, and one could put up with this, if not the popularity of such trends. \n\nBelozersky contacted multiple printing magnates in order for him to commission the preparation of a series of articles on the topic of Nicholas II. In negotiations with these magnates, the Tsar-General set one condition – to expose all the troubles and all the failures of the reign of Nicholas II and show how bad he really was, for which he promised in the future to give them bonuses on behalf of the Tsar himself for a very large sum of money. In addition, in order to avoid what will happen after this growth of communist ideas, we will also have to blame the Bolsheviks and Lenin for the defeat of the Russian Empire in the First World War. \n\nAfter some time, the editors of these same newspapers were able to make several articles on this topic. If you read carefully, you can find a sharp criticism of the reign of Nicholas II and all his actions. Those things, the little that was good in the reign of this Tsar, were also turned into failures and failures, and everything was thrown off on Nicholas II. Many who managed to catch this time gave an ambiguous reaction, many of them were not happy that such a glorious time from their point of view was turned into a shameful one, but the bulk of the population believed in these main theses. Many articles that accused Nicholas II of incompetence ended with attacks on the Bolsheviks led by Lenin. The writers of the articles come to the conclusion that Lenin, instead of saving Russia from defeat in the war, only pushed it to the abyss, and thus they are also guilty of the fall of the empire. In total, it turns out that both Tsar Nicholas II himself and Lenin and his communist clique are to blame for the fall of Russia during this period of time. \n\nCommunists and conservative White Guard were left without the support of the population, and now the influence of these elements will significantly decrease."

The realization of this fact made Vasily feel even more proud for his people and for his country, which will soon unite under a single flag.\n\nUnfortunately, the lesson flew by too quickly, many people wanted to hear the continuation of this story, but they had to go to another lesson.

Even though we understand that most things Nicholas II did were not sustainable, there are some implementations that are worthwhile. The idea of “Police Socialism” was able to hold back the revolution for a long time, and let the Empire live.\n\nSergei Zubatov, the main proponent of this concept, was a worthy servant, who destroyed revolutionary cells that hid behind the facade of unions. We need to employ his ideas for ourselves and use his methods against subversive elements."

  berez_belozerski.8.d:0 "Belozersky was collecting reports for the past month in order to make at least for himself some kind of complete picture of what is happening in the country. He rejoiced that since the unification of Western Russia, the state under his leadership began to rise and develop rapidly. One could only dream of such a thing under Bukharin, and indeed, everything was going quite well. At least as it could be seen from the reports.\n\nUntil Tretyakov Ivanovich, the chief clerk of the internal security of Western Russia, entered the office. Before that, of course, he asked permission to enter, to which he received a positive response. He entered quickly enough, even though he was holding a whole stack of reports from the order of the interior, on which there were about several dozen pencil underscores about the real state of affairs. Specifically, there were marked cases of rallies organized almost out of the blue for no particular reason.\n\nTretyakov reached the table and put this stack of reports next to the reports of other clerks.\n-- What is it? – Belozersky asked the question a few seconds later, clearly with an expression of incomprehension.\n— This, my Tsar, - said Tretyakov, picking up the topmost report and looking for notes that he had managed to make by this point – is the report. You know that we have trade unions in our country, right?\n-- Yes, I know, and let me guess – did you come on this issue? – Belozersky asked with some skepticism.\n- Exactly. Judging by these newspapers that I brought you, underground communist cells have been operating in our country for a long time. They undermine the situation in our country by not showing themselves in public and pretending to be only members of a trade union. Because of them, our industrialists are beginning to lose losses, and most importantly, they are beginning to push workers to commit revolutionary activities. Probably, this is the activity of Communists from the Western Front, who still did not accept defeat.\n-I suppose you want to do something about it – Belozersky asked a question.\n-- Yes, – said Tretyakov, - we need to fight this. We have a good experience of the past, specifically my colleague in the shop in the person of Zubatov. His activity shows that it is so easy to fight the communist threat that is lurking right now inside the trade unions.\"An interesting suggestion,\" said Belozersky, who was listening attentively to Tretyakov, \"I think I will allow you to start developing methods to combat this scourge.\n\nIt is very difficult to simply copy the \"zubatovism\" in this situation. The reason for this is that the trade unions, although they undermine the economy in this way, as a result, they do nothing beyond illegal. Therefore, we must do something else – register all trade unions and teach them not to act against the government or enterprises, but to try to achieve a compromise in negotiations. To do this, it is necessary to understand the difference between the workers' and the revolutionary movement: in the first case, the goal is a penny, in the second — an ideological theory. Such an explanation will allow our workers not to be provoked by these subversives of public opinion."

At the moment, this issue is very important, because overexpansion oppresses the state apparatus, which has only recently appeared relatively recently.\n\nBelozersky observes how some officials cannot cope with the amount of work they have. They have, if not thousands, then hundreds of papers that some officials cannot handle. This is due to the fact that the responsibilities of some ministers are too huge, while they have to work in more narrow specialties. What used to be necessary for ministers to work in many areas is now ineffective. We need to change this state of affairs.\n\nThe tsar, who wants his state apparatus to work more efficiently, instructed his friend Kazem bek to develop a draft reform of ministries. A few days later, Kazem-bek, after conferring with the current ministers, provided a version of the reform to Belozersky.\n\nReform by ministries, in general, solves the main problem of the administration – the workload of documents and the broad powers and responsibilities of ministries on various issues. They narrow down all these parameters significantly, and as a result, solve the problem with administrative workload. In order to further destroy this problem and facilitate the governance of the country as a whole, it was necessary to establish a number of new ministries that would have authority on certain issues in the state. For example, the Ministry of Digital Technologies and Communications will be established.\n\nBelozersky read and was impressed by the scope of the reform. However, he took a pencil and crossed out the inscription \"ministries\" with it, writing \"prikazy\" next to it. Kazem-bek raised his right eyebrow questioningly and frowned, clearly not understanding what Belozersky was doing. The tsar-general told him: \"If you remember, I promised people to return the good times of the strong people of Russia, and these times coincide with the reign of Ivan III the Great and Ivan IV. I think we should keep our promise.\" Kazem-bek, grinned a little with a questioning look, nevertheless, was forced to agree with the tsar's decision."

In addition he proposes we help villages mechanize their agriculture, to increase irrigation metrics.

If we don’t want this opposition to burden us in the future, decisive actions have to be done as fast as possible.\n\nSeeing this, Kazem-bek suggested the expulsion of the opposition from the party via different methods, beginning with demotions for apparent misdeeds and ending with sending these members into early retirement.

In the course of discussions, the worst decisions were rejected and the best ideas were adopted. At this time, Belozersky just watched and sometimes entered into conversation with officials.

Although it was not in his competence, but he violated this restriction and simply helped his civil servants to his liking.\n\nAfter a week and a half of such discussions, the First Congress developed a program of action for the next quarter.

The tsar instructed Kosygin, as one of the competent people in the economy, to develop a plan that will be implemented in the near future\n\nKosygin's main idea is a number of theses. First of all, this is the creation of a special economic management body, the so–called Economic Order of the national Economy, which will be responsible for everything related to economic processes – industry, internal and external trade, taxes and so on. Secondly, his plan is that we should develop the country's economy not only on our own, but also by attracting investments from outside. Special emphasis is placed here on the creation of heavy industry, which will produce military products.\n\nIn parallel with all this, we need to solve a lot of other, equally important issues, such as: education, small and medium-sized businesses, agricultural development and much more. Kosygin, of course, provided for this and presented, if not a ready-made version, then at least sketches of how it would all be done.\n\n—My tsar, I ask you to note that by this action we will be able to provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of unemployed people with work and thereby increase the welfare of the population.  Alexey Kosygin finished his story.\n\nTsar Belozersky listened attentively to every word of Kosygin. The plan proposed by Alexey seemed to Sergey very interesting and even logical.\n\nSergey, after ten seconds of thinking about what to say, gave out, - I like the plan, there's nothing even to find fault with. But how expensive can all this cost us?\n\n-\"It won't take as much money as you think, my King.

No one wants to cooperate with the Mladorossi state, at least because we are underestimated, and at most because few people realized that we were reborn from the ashes at all. This fact is very offensive for Belozersky.\n\nExactly! Foreign ministers. We need to create our own Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to be more precise, an Embassy Order, which will be engaged in establishing diplomatic relations with other countries. It is only necessary to create the Embassy Order itself. And even though the First Congress of Soviets adopted a plan for the foreign policy development of our country, nevertheless, it was necessary to start implementing it sooner or later anyway.\n\nBelozersky entrusted the work of creating an Embassy Order to Kazem-bek, and he, in turn, began to gather the people he needed, who would become the first ambassadors to the states and begin to establish ties with potential allies. First of all, on behalf of Belozersky himself, the ambassadors will go to OFN countries – to the USA, Canada and other such countries. Kazem-bek selects people based on how educated they are, whether they speak the right languages, whether they are polite enough and whether they comply with a number of criteria that a good diplomat needs.\n\nEventually he was able to find the right people. The first ambassadors and diplomats began to prepare for service abroad. Our country must come out of diplomatic isolation and contact the outside world. And we will definitely do it soon."

Indeed, iron ore, which was exported from Russia, is really 1.5 times cheaper than Australian, and 3 times cheaper than Canadian. With all this, it is quite realistic that the quality of iron is high and generally competitive with Western analogues.\n\nHe had iron reserves for another 3 months ahead, but he decided to request the purchase of iron now, because approximately during the delivery of the cargo, the iron reserves would run out, and he would have to wait for the delivery of a new cargo for a long time. Therefore, the administrator decided to take care of this in advance. As a result, he felt that in general he had saved quite a lot of money, and he was glad that ore from Russia would arrive soon."

He rose to the rank of major, after which he went to Russia at his own request. Who would have thought that Sergei's fate would turn so abruptly and he would become the tsar of Russia.\n\nBelozersky wanted to build up diplomatic relations with the United States not so much even for pragmatic reasons, as for these very nostalgic motives. The tsar pondered – how can relations with the States be improved further? He wanted to improve them even more. However, after looking at the work of his diplomats, he, let's say, became sad, due to the fact that business on building relations is extremely slow.\n\nThere is such a saying - if you want to do well, do it yourself. Belozersky will do so – he will go to the United States himself and personally talk to the American president. It is in a personal conversation that he will talk everything over with the president and thereby accelerate the building of relations, and most importantly, it will give additional opportunities for Mladorossi Russia.\n\nHaving agreed on a meeting with the President through his ambassadors, he flew to Washington on a transatlantic plane. After almost a day of flight, he found himself in the US capital, where he went from the airport in a motorcade to the White House. The meeting was scheduled at a strictly defined time and Belozersky was ideally on the spot by this time. When the motorcade finished its journey, the doormen opened the door for the Tsar and the White House guards greeted him. Belozersky was escorted inside the White House and he entered the president's office.\n\nThe President and Belozersky started a conversation. The tsar-general knew English well, since he had previously served in the US army, and the knowledge he acquired turned out to be in demand again for this case, so there were no problems in communication between the president and the tsar. At the beginning of the conversation, Sergey introduced himself to the president, telling briefly about his life and he paid special attention to the American service. He planned to devote about half an hour to this, and in half an hour other topics of communication were also touched upon. Judging by the way the president listened to Belozersky, he was impressed by the adventures of the still young Sergei. Having achieved the necessary predisposition to communicate on more serious topics, the Tsar began a conversation about cooperation with the United States and the OFN in general.\n\nBelozersky asked the President to simplify the process of building relations between the US and Western-Russian People`s Kingdom, Russia to attract to the work of foreign specialists in the military and economic spheres, and, in addition, conclude agreements directed against German and other-other agreement.\n\nThe discussion of all these conditions went faster than it would have been with the ambassadors of the two countries, but the president was careful in his statements. Belozersky, using all his oratory and fueling interest in the topic with possible benefits for the OFN, he was able to achieve all the desired agreements that he wanted to achieve with the United States. This whole meeting lasted longer than it was planned until 3 PM. In 3 hours Belozersky achieved a guarantee of the development of our state.\n\nBelozersky, after he had agreed with the president, was in Washington for about a day in order to take a break from the flight, then to get on the plane again and return to his homeland."

After the collapse of the USSR, this northern city was the center of the Western Russian Revolutionary Front, but it was in outright desolation. This city has mainly lived off trade with Europe from time immemorial, but after the defeat in the Great Patriotic War, this city was not needed by anyone, neither by us nor by Western colleagues.\n\nBut not today. According to the schedule, an important convoy was supposed to arrive today, which will give a second life to Arkhangelsk. Vasily, responsible for the port, was watching the horizon, from where a large convoy of merchant ships was to arrive. The tonnage of these ships was large, such ships had not been seen in Russia for a long time, perhaps, since the time of Bukharin. Judging by the list of the cargo that was supposed to come with the ships, there was a lot of industrial equipment with their classification. Vasily knows a little English, but he has no idea what kind of equipment it is and does not know whether it is modern or not. Nevertheless, his common sense told him that this was advanced equipment, which in Russia could not even dream of.\n\nFinally, when the ships finally appeared over the horizon. In the binoculars, you could clearly see what kind of flags of the country were on top of the ships - the flags of the United States, and they are on schedule. Vasily ordered his men to prepare to meet their American colleagues and gave permission to dock in Arkhangelsk.\n\nThe ships finally stopped near the ports, and the unloading equipment that was in Arkhangelsk began to pull out boxes with new machines. Every worker looked at these boxes with trepidation, trying to figure out what was inside. Some of the other ships were carrying people who looked like military men. These were military specialists invited by Belozersky himself to train Russian soldiers in hand-to-hand combat, tactical techniques and generally improve the skills of our fighters. As soon as these specialists left the ships, they were picked up by a military truck, which was taken, apparently, to a military unit, where they already began to deal directly with matters within their competence.\n\nAs soon as the unloading of the ships was over, Vasily received a report about it and sent the report to his boss up to the trade clerk. Now that the first convoy has finally arrived in Russia in the dilapidated Arkhangelsk, it has received a second life and a sense of existence."

In accordance with the plan "Ost", the Nazis created Reichkommissariats in the Russian territories, dividing the once unified country into many small ones. Among such states, which are governed almost directly from Berlin, there is one that differs from all others - the RK Moskowien.\n\n The Reichskommissariat Moskowien is the first line of defense of the Reich against the Russians, who still retain independence. Russian Russians were the first to be hit during the West Russian War, when the Soviets almost reached Moscow, Leningrad and other cities that are no less important for the Russian people. However, our people were defeated in this liberation campaign, and now we are separated from Moscow by 400 kilometers, which we still need to manage to overcome.\n\n Despite the fact that the Reichskommissariat has gaping holes in the defense, in fact, such a formidable force should not be underestimated. Its relative weakness is compensated by the length of the front, which we should also cover. In addition, we still need to get to the important cities of the RK Moskowien, and while our troops are advancing, this Reichskommissariat can detain us until the main Nazi forces approach. And then our military campaign will be doomed to failure.\n\n Our plan is to weaken the Reichskommissariat from within as much as possible. Russian people, most likely, also want liberation, and therefore we should take advantage of this situation by sending our agents of influence and inciting Russian soldiers in the RK to mutiny and disobedience, and in order to do this, we must make a small safe corridor with the help of a border skirmish in the place where it will be most convenient for our agents of influence to pass. Thus, we can still look at what tactics the enemy uses against us and assess their overall combat readiness.\n\n The plan on paper is extremely simple, but it has a complex implementation. Our plan is audacious, and nevertheless necessary, to probe the enemy by force. Perhaps this will lead to the fact that Germany will be the first to attack us from such an audacious attack, but they have long received and are still receiving reports about the dead border guards on the eastern borders of their Reich, and therefore they will most likely miss the next report on the attack and will not pay attention."

Until now, partisans are operating on the territory of the Nazi sphere of influence, who are waging a desperate struggle to exterminate opponents like the same Germans, and this hatred of the Nazi invaders unites everyone - Russians, Little Russians, Poles and even Jews and other peoples who are now groaning under the heel Nazis.\n\nIt would be wise for us to help our guerrillas, and some even to help set up a government in exile. Belozersky instructed his people in orders to create departments for helping partisans outside the Mladorossky state and to create a department for governments in exile, and first of all to convene here the ambassadors of the Polish Republic, which refused to obey the Nazis.\n\nThese ambassadors came to Russia and they began to establish diplomatic relations with our country. There can be no talk of any economic agreements, but these are political acts - Russia has pledged to help Poland regain its independence after liberation from the Nazi occupiers. The ambassadors of the Polish Republic in exile were very pleased that they had just acquired new allies in us and that they would not be in debt in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, while the ambassadors were establishing relations with us, we created a department for communications and coordination of our partisans in Eastern Europe. We contacted, if not all, then at least the largest partisan cells that operate on the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and, of course, in Muscovy. Using the holes in the border of Muscovy, we can transport part of our equipment there, to the east, and coordinate the actions of these partisan detachments so that they strike where we need them first.\n\nThanks to our connections, we learned the true state of affairs in the Reich - the situation of the slaves is frankly hopeless, and the people are just as ready to rise up to fight the invaders.

Maxim found a short time of prosperity, which could be earned either by his own labor, or by the hired labor of others.\n\nHowever, this time quickly ended, and when he turned 18, the father of the family instructed Maxim to monitor the household until he returned home, because the war with the Bolsheviks had begun. Nevertheless, my father has not yet returned, and may have died a long time ago in Siberia, fighting on the side of Kolchak, but we will never know for sure. As soon as the Bolsheviks came to these lands, it immediately became much more difficult for the "kulaks" to live, eventually collectivization began in 1928, where the Kulak farm was selected in favor of the collective farm.\n\nMaxim did not resist the Bolsheviks, but he regretted that his land was taken and taken away so easily, and besides, it was very unfair, as he himself believes: he was on good terms with other peasants, but the law was the law – it was necessary to collectivize all farms. Since then, he also worked on the collective farm for a long time, but suddenly there was a war that destroyed those new orders.\n\nThe Great Patriotic War destroyed Bukharin's Soviet Union, but the collective farms as a whole were still functioning until the second collapse occurred – the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed, and a new state was already in place where Maxim's collective farm was, and it was disbanded.

The peasants agreed to help him cultivate the land.\n\nGrandfather was finally calm, he again received a guarantee that he would not live in poverty in peace. All his children and grandchildren are in the cities now, but they can't help their grandfather right now.

Someone went somewhere, someone to Germany, to France, someone in Siberia fled to Manchuria, and specifically the Pechorins fled far away to the USA, and despite the fact that he was listed as an American, he was a Russian man, and accordingly lived in a Russian ghetto, where everyone spoke Russian.\n\nBrighton Beach was similar to the very little Russia that was lost in 1917, but Vladimir had never seen his big Homeland firsthand. All his information about what was going on there was reduced to newspaper lines of weekly news about Russia. As an ardent anti-communist, he hated the Soviet Union, but he empathized with the fate of his homeland, no matter what. And he experienced great grief when he learned that the USSR was destroyed in the Great Patriotic War, and after the final collapse of Russia, he completely fell into despondency. After these events, newspaper lines about Russia were extremely scarce and abrupt, from which he could only draw one simple conclusion: Russia had disappeared.\n\nHowever, he was extremely surprised when he found out in another newspaper publication that Russia had begun to recover. He was particularly attracted by an event related to the restoration of the monarchy in Western Russia under the leadership of some Mladorossi. He hadn't heard much about them, but Vladimir wasn't very interested in all of this. But as soon as they united this region, detailed news about what was happening there immediately went. And he read that real creative work is underway in Russia to restore all the good old orders using new modern methods, which obviously could not but inspire Vladimir Pechorin.\n\nAfter all these inspiring newspapers that the restoration of the Motherland is taking place in Russia under the banner of the Mladorossi, Vladimir Pechorin is already thinking with his family to sail from New York to Russia, to his great homeland. And not only he alone is already thinking about it, but at least a few more of his clients ordering a taxi."

They are all united by the same circumstances: the attack of a certain person on passers-by occurs at a clear distance from everyone else, and all the victims have the same head injury, often with a fatal outcome. \n\nInvestigator Leonid Kanevsky is conducting his own investigation into this matter. He has so far come to the following conclusions: attacks always occur from behind and blows occur with a very heavy object – either a hammer or a club. Therefore, for a simpler appeal in this case, they decided to call this thug a Hammer-breaker. \n\nThose who suffered, but did not die, cannot give clear testimony about who did it. There are no assumptions about why this person commits attacks on ordinary citizens in general, because citizens rarely carry something more expensive than 100-150 rubles, therefore, only extremely narrow-minded criminals can commit such attacks. And he was clearly not stupid. Then he's just a maniac who commits murders for fun? Or for some purpose?

She had a notebook in her hands, which apparently prompted her to go to the police station and apparently was the cause of concern. What she read there shocked her, and it's not just about what is written there – the problem is that she believes that it was all done by the hands of her students, because she found this notebook under the school desk at the end of the working day. \n\nApproaching the police station, she climbed up the steps and opened the door, and she waited for some more time in order to address the police officer himself. After a few more minutes, she entered the office, next to which there was a sign, clearly referring to the fact that the district police officer's name was Leonid Kanevsky. \n\nThe teacher gave a notebook to Kanevsky and told the circumstances of the discovery. Kanevsky began to read this notebook first, and he was immediately struck by what was written on the first pages. The inscription was like this: "Red Brigades – for true communism!", where the letter M was written a little lower due to the fact that there was not enough space. A star with a swastika was drawn in the center of the entire drawing, which clearly gives an idea of what this notebook is all about. Outwardly, the notebook was a little worn, but the text was written very smoothly and almost without any typos and grammar errors. Some lines especially strongly catch the eye:\n\n"... Mladorossi of Kazem-bek, together with Tsar Sergei Belozersky, are not real carriers of Russian spirituality, hiding under the guise of "Russianness", they strive to combine the best socialist ideas with delusional monarchical rudiments of the past..."\n\n"... This government was supported by naive people who believe that they can return in such an easy way to the well-being that they lost under the tsars, under Bukharin and others. They naively believe that this path is easy because it is right. This is far from the case. Russian Russian nation's true path of development lies through "left fascism", a mixture of Russian identity and socialism, which glows in the depths of the Russian consciousness..."\n\n"... To achieve far-reaching goals, all means are good: bribery, blackmail, murder, military terror, agitation and propaganda among the masses. The idea of the "Red Brigades" is to include their people in the state apparatus of the existing regime in order to build a truly Russian-communist party...\n\nKanevsky was stunned. In addition, there is a lot of speculation about the "magic number" 36. He did not read this notebook much anymore, and he told the school teacher that he would sort out the whole thing. Leonid decided to give the notebook immediately to the local department of the MSS that same day. Graphological examination shows that the text was written by an adult. Immediately after that, the version that the student wrote it disappears. However, it was necessary to figure out where this notebook still got to school. A preventive conversation was immediately held with the students of the school, the results of which revealed that no one has any mental inclinations or dissident thoughts. This complicates the whole thing. \n\nMeanwhile, the number of victims has already reached 30 victims..."

This is the 36th attack in all this time, and you think he won't stop killing our people?! We've been looking for him for too long, and while we're looking, he's killing everyone! I demand from you to immediately strengthen patrols, strengthen surveillance, investigate all currently released criminals! Do everything to stop him!\n\nEverything he said was done. In order to further support the work of his patrols, he personally drives a company car with the others in order to find the same hammer fighter as quickly as possible. Kanevsky's determination was firm, and he wanted at all costs to catch this bully, wherever he was.\n\nOne afternoon, a police patrol headed by Leonid himself was driving around. They drove and peered into the crowd of people. At first it seemed that there would be absolutely nothing interesting to discover there. However, the gaze was riveted on one pair of men who were standing somewhat apart from everyone else. The first man had a briefcase, the second was without everything. Anyway, the second turned back to the road and only when he saw the police cars, he took off and ran as fast as possible in the other direction.\n\nKanevsky immediately ordered the second car coming from behind:\n- Second, take that guy with the bag! I'm going after the runner!\n- The first one, on my way! \n\nThe second car stopped on the road next to the man and he was immediately tied up and sent to the police station. The first one, where Kanevsky was, was driving fast behind a running man. However, it didn't work out to chase him for a long time, because he literally ran around the corner and disappeared obviously in an unknown direction. It would be possible to wander around the area for an extremely long time, and during this time he would run out of the chain.\n\nReturning to the man with the briefcase, we immediately decided to inspect this briefcase. There was a club in the briefcase, tied with some rags with blood. Trying to unwind the rags to understand the device of a homemade club, blood flowed from there. The briefcase also contained the manifesto of the "Red Brigade". The manifesto was exactly identical to the one given by the school teacher of the 127th school. However, the man himself was an absolutely unremarkable driver of the production department. So much so that even at first they did not believe at all that he could be the killer of 36 victims. And he confessed that he really didn't commit the murder.\n\nHe gave evidence and a tip to his friends and buddies. Attention was attracted by someone named Viktor Osipov, who was a huge guy under two meters tall. It became almost obvious that it was he who was the hammerer. He was immediately also taken under arrest and began to beat out testimony from both, because Kanevsky was absolutely sure that neither Viktor Osipov nor the driver of the department could be the "think tanks" of the "Red Brigade". The driver, who was not a convinced criminal, told everything, and he called the leader – Alexey Pustavo."

In the deep evening, driving up to the entrance, they met with a boy of the 5th grade. The staff asked for his name, but the boy only said his last name – Empty.\n\nA little confused, Kanevsky asked the boy to tell him where his brother Alexey was. He said that he was at home, and he indicated the apartment number, after which the staff immediately began to go to him.\n\nLater, a small preparation for the storming of Alexei's house began. Pustovity immediately realized what kind of people had come to him and began to prepare for defense, and the only thing he had at hand was a knife, which he decided to use in order to attack the MSS officers. Finally, the storming of the house began, and literally from the very first seconds, Vladimir attacked the employees with a knife. A big noise arose, one of the employees took this man and resisted until Vladimir was shot in the torso.\n\nKanevsky was clearly enraged by this outcome – he said: "Well, that's it, you killed him. We should have taken him alive, fools!". But immediately his tone changed to a more businesslike one and he ordered the staff to collect all the documents and data that could be collected from his room. Later, Vladimir's personal diary was taken away, from which we can only learn that he was bullied as a child and at school for being short and for wearing glasses. Apparently, this prompted him to embark on the path of destroying all the old regimes in order to build a new, ideal one, as he believes.\n\nThe meaning of the number 36 is also explained – this magic number means the sum of the numbering of letters in the Russian alphabet, and he compared his name with Bonaparte, who also came out, according to Pustov's calculations, the number 36.\n\nIt is obvious that the leader of the "Red Brigades" was killed, and it remains only to publish the news that a gang of "Hammers", who, as it turns out, called themselves "Red Brigades", was liquidated. Pustovit obviously admired Hitler, Napoleon, and dreamed of conquering the world, but the only thing he has in common with tyrants is how he ended his life like them, who thought they had every right to direct the destinies of the lives of the whole world."

This campaign, comparable to Ermak's campaign outside the Urals, will be remembered by subsequent generations after us. The Russian people are not losing from this, but are winning, as we are getting closer to the former unity of our nation.\n\n After we crushed another pseudo-state on the territory of Russia, we became one step closer to the unification of Russia. The people, divided by ideological dogmas and the boundaries of these non-rulers, have become even more united, and now a free and strong Russia stretches from the borders of the Reichskommissariat of Muscovy to the outskirts of Central Siberia. But before we go beyond the new borders to the next stage of unification, we need to establish order in the new territories.We have a lot of problems on these lands, and therefore we need to convene a full-fledged extraordinary congress of Soviets, which will solve the issues that have just arisen after the expansion of our state."

There were representatives of both the very first congresses and those who represented completely new territories, hastily created so that someone would represent the interests of their territory.\n\n"Gentlemen, comrades and compatriots! Kazem-bek began his speech with these words with an unusually fiery intonation. - "We have achieved unprecedented success recently! Our country was able to go to Siberia!" - After such a statement, a roar of applause and a loud "Hurrah!" rose in the hall. It all lasted for about a minute, and after the applause began to subside, the Prime Minister continued: "Our people have become even closer to the unification of Russia under one flag! Our people are more and more eager to unite our great Motherland every day, and we have already shown the whole world that we are capable of it!" The roar of applause rose again, but not as intense as it was the first time. After another hum, Kazem-bek reminded everyone why the congress was convened.\n\n"But it's not the time to stop. Today we have large territories outside the Urals, which extend to the borders of Central Siberia. In the new territories that we have come to, it is obvious that there are many problems that we can face.

We need to create an action program for today aimed at solving these issues and start implementing our plans."The work began, and at the end of the extraordinary congress of Soviets, an action program was developed aimed at solving problems in Western Siberia.

Lazarenko's detachment was located approximately where the center of the entire Black League was once, but it was forced to be in areas where there are at least some forests in order to hide from a direct clash with its enemies.\n\ pAlexander Lazarenko, despite all his baggage of skills, owned a squad that, although it seemed quite capable to itself, in fact had in its composition gnawed tatters, which half of them were not dressed properly. His efforts to improve logistics within his squad improved the situation from hopeless to better, nevertheless, a number of objective reasons did not change the situation in the bud. Many did not have Black League bandages, as the fabric was used for bandages. On the faces of some, hunger brought them to the point that they had black circles under their eyes, and someone simply collapsed from exhaustion. The armament also left much to be desired, the squad was armed with a variety of weapons, ranging from outdated PPSH-41, ending with something AK-47-like assault rifles. The only thing that distinguished them from the bandits was the presence of an entire T-34-85 tank, which certainly could pose a serious danger to the rest. And yet, what exactly cannot be taken away from the soldiers of the Black League is their fighting spirit and desperate determination to fight for their idea.\n\The pRadists of his squad are trying to keep in touch with other squads, smaller and very weak in comparison with his squad. However, every day there are fewer and fewer detachments that still get in touch, until the connection is completely cut off. In the language of the Black League detachments, this means that they either went missing or were destroyed, and by whom it is difficult to say, because recently the Young Russians have come here, at least as rumors are heard from beyond the Urals, the pathetic remnants of the "Batovites" have also become active, which do not pose any danger to the Young Russians.As soon as the soldiers arrived, they began to form up in a line of four, while the cadets stood behind Lazarenko. When everyone gathered, he began his speech, which he had been trying to work out in his head for a long time so that it sounded truthful, but fiery:\n\n"Comrades of the black league! Our scouts reported that an army of Young Russians was moving in our direction. Our squad was the very last of all who remained alive. Our comrades died fighting the traitors of the Motherland to the last drop of blood. Our brothers sacrificed their lives so that our motherland would atone for the sins of the past! And we remained the last stronghold of the Black League, the last chance to save our great Motherland!\n\n Our idea of the redemption of Russia lives in the hearts of people, and only thanks to us our cause has not yet perished. I have to tell you that tomorrow will be the most important day for all of you. Tomorrow – there will be a fight. Perhaps the last, but extremely important for all our future generations. Let the whole of Russia know that we have not bowed our heads! We will not obey anyone, neither the Young Russians, nor the Communists, nor the Batovians! Let the whole of Russia know that we have not given up! That we fought for the cause of our children, our brothers, our sisters and mothers, that we fought for our land, for our home, and for every Russian person!\n\pVrag will not show us mercy. So let it! We will respond with tenfold hatred for our opponents! They will pay tenfold for our death, we will either win here, or we will die free and unconquered!

We need to take a break from work, which has already tired us during this time. Together with his guards, he went to Tyumen, as one of the largest cities in Western Siberia. In the end, he, as the owner of this land, had to look at the newly conquered territories with his own eyes, and so he decided to kill two birds with one stone at once. \n\nThe question of what Tyumen looks like in architectural terms is of great interest to him. As he was informed, earlier in Tyumen there was a government of Kaganovich, a socialist who supported the little-known Joseph Stalin in the struggle against Nikolai Bukharin. How would history have gone if Stalin had more strength and he would have defeated Bukharin? Belozersky thought about this moment, not even paying attention to what majestic buildings were erected in Tyumen. Belozersky could only imagine the consequences of such a scenario, where Joseph Stalin became the leader of a huge country of Soviets. Perhaps the story ended more tragically even for the Russian people than under Bukharin. It is possible that the story would be the same as in our reality. What if it would have been different? What if in that parallel reality the Russian people were able to defeat the Nazis? I'm afraid to imagine how it would look, and from such a thought, the spirit is taken away from the majesty and captivates from the fear of what place he would take in this world. Fortunately or unfortunately, fate decreed quite differently. Speaking about the city itself, the architecture of all these buildings causes pride for the Russian people, who were able to build it even under a hail of Nazi bombs. Tall houses are a luxury even for the capital of Belozersky, not to mention the provinces. However, all these buildings pale in front of a seemingly clearly inferior architectural structure - the Lenin Mausoleum. Belozersky's attention was riveted to this building, since it was remarkable in itself among others, and what was there was literally the mummified body of Lenin, the man who created the revolution, and in fact laid the foundation for the future for Russia. Thoughts of Stalin and Bukharin were smoothly replaced by thoughts of Vladimir Ilyich, and he even said with a certain cynicism in his head that if it weren't for this man, none of this would have happened. At least, as he could reason. If it were not for him and his party, then in the distant 60s Belozersky would not have become the tsar of Great Russia, which is now beginning to rise from its knees. If it had not been for him, there would have been neither the same Stalin nor the same Bukharin, and if it had not been for them, there would have been no what happened in the Great Patriotic War, there would have been no Battle for Western Russia, there would have been no victory of the Young Russian Dream in Russia. There would be nothing. Belozersky watched as this mausoleum was slowly being dismantled, because they decided to dismantle it and build a new house in its place, and it was decided to bury Lenin's body with a calm soul. Belozersky did not prevent them from doing this, and he drove on through Tyumen."

The US President said that these agreements can be concluded and therefore he agrees.Following this, Belozersky proposed to sign a non-aggression pact between the OSN countries and the Tsarist Union.

And he needed them now more than ever, because just a few weeks ago Kazakhstan became part of the Tsarist Union, and he needed to establish the power of the Mladorosses there. To do this, he intended to use Alexander to organize everything there from scratch, so that everything would work. Why exactly in this way? There is no normal civil and party power in Kazakhstan right now, there is only a military occupation there, which means that you have to build the power there essentially from scratch. On a clean field, like the steppes of Kazakhstan itself.Belozersky entrusted this job to Kazem-Bek, and he took this responsible job not to say with great enthusiasm.

The journey did not take too much time, but it was decent, since the distances between the cities were long.\n\nIn the tsar's impressions were not marred by any incidents, but the journey itself... left some mixed feelings. First, he liked the very existence of the railroad, and the way it was done very well. Secondly, as he visited the cities, he was glad to see that the population greeted him cheerfully, though not as a triumphant. The population, however, thanked him and the entire government for bringing to Kazakhstan the many benefits of civilizations that had gone into disrepair before them. Third, administrations, factories, entertainment centers and everything else that should have given the common citizen the greatest comforts of life were reviewed and inspected. And the condition of many cities satisfied the wishes of the tsar himself.\n\n\n\nBut there were negative aspects as well. The tsar was not satisfied with the fact that the areas between the cities were still in disrepair. Much of it was either not being cultivated or not being used, and the distances between the major cities themselves were very large, which on the whole did not please Sergei. These territories, according to the tsar, should be inhabited by as many people as possible, but nothing has been done to this end. It is worth noting that Kazem-Bek and Belozersky talked a lot on various business topics and simply about life during the trip. They discussed the same Kazakhstan, what were the difficulties in creating all these conditions and other things. Kazem-Bek, and perhaps King Sergei Belozersky himself, could relax from hard work for the first time in such a long time.nn After the trip to Kazakhstan, the royal delegation, together with the Prime Minister, wanted to go back to the capital, together by plane."

These two extreme systems waged an uncompromising struggle on the territory of Russia with periodic success. Any person in our place would either accept one of the sides, or would choose a third way. But we went the other way - we found a compromise between the monarchy and socialism, which gave the result.\n\nThe Russians have created a truly unique country, unlike any other. Our state can be slandered in any way, starting from monarchists with a left bias, ending with communists with the tsar at the head. We are neither one nor the other - we are Young Russians. The Russian people have trusted our leadership, and fate favors us to unite the whole of Russia, which will stretch from Vologda in the west to Kamchatka in the East.\n\n\n\nThe young State, cleansed of the flaws of the past, appeared on the world map. This, without exaggeration, the car finally started moving after we got rid of the mistakes of the first creators and those who tried to fix it. The combination of monarchical and socialist ideas has given a truly resounding success, which is possible only within Russia.

Some went to official festive events, which were organized by the party of the Young Russians by decree of his Tsarist Majesty - Sergei I the Unifier. And while ordinary people celebrated and rested, others continued to serve. So the Tsarist Foreign Ministry was bursting with calls with congratulations from different countries, even the Japanese government congratulated us and informed us that it would be happy to cooperate with Russia, despite various grievances in the past.The military also had a hard time, the territory in the east was extremely extensive and establishing a normal land border was still a task, however, it was less of a problem - it was still necessary to deal with the various types of partisans who remained in this territory, but at least it was easier than fighting.\n\nWhat was the Tsar's Cabinet doing at that time?

There have NEVER been popular Kings or Queens. You can't trust those people whose dynasty has been on the throne for hundreds of years. They have become other people, they have severed their connection to the people. They only confirm their legitimacy with a "divine right" that never existed!

However, after Solzhenitsyn's coup, the "workers' rights" were quickly removed: they destroyed the councils, reduced wages, removed the boss elected by the workers for some unknown person, and also increased the working day. Clearly, Solzhenitsyn's government stupidly transported all the titanium to Vyatka, so that already the Tsar and his entourage were earning their keep.\n\n\n\nThe working day began, and Andrei no longer had any enthusiasm to do anything.

Confused about ideology, confused about country, confused about leaders. I can help you untangle this thread. The White Guards and their false czar Vladimir want to take control of Russia. Vladimir betrayed his country during the West Russian War, when he took the German side. How can we trust this man after that? Look at what his dog Solzhenitsyn did when he came to power! He wanted to drown us in blood, but we won. However, we only won the battle, not the war. You can argue to me that I am only a dictator. That I use "peoplehood" as my weapon. But even so, tell me: will you serve traitors? Will you serve those who destroyed our country to shreds? The soldiers sharply said, "No! All of them were ready to fight this snake. All of them were ready to destroy monarchism, and they were ready to go along with the new leader, Vladimir Gil.\n\n\n\n- We will never go after the Tsars again.

These two ideologies, two dogmas and two opposites lead nowhere. Bukharin's Soviet Union and the Tsarist Russian Empire perished because they proved ineffective in the face of the challenges of the times, and in addition were themselves flawed in most of their dogmas. The Russian Empire, led by the pseudo-Russian Tsar Nicholas II, did terrible damage to the Russian nation, completely ignoring the hardships and privations which had accumulated over the centuries of our history. It itself, however, was not strong enough to defend its own power and its own people against the revolutionary elements of the Judeo-Bolshevik faction led by Lenin. Bukharin's USSR, with its extreme internationalism and even cosmopolitanism, made the Russian nation rotten to the point that it was unable to pull itself together and fight back against the Nazi threat. \n\nWe are not advocates of degenerate liberalism and anti-human Nazism. The liberalism of the Western world has proven to be extremely degenerate, because the beautiful ideas of equality for all conceal the emptiness and soullessness of the human race. Without a moral solid core, they were destroyed by the German machine, the same spiritual inhuman machine, which milled so many people that it began to overreact itself and thus found itself in the deepest crisis, showing all its inefficiency before history.\n\nThe Russian way - to keep up with the times and become fascist - to combine real, Russian socialism with the preservation of the Russian identity. Our own way of the Mladorossians, as was originally correctly set forth at the beginning of the path, is through fascism. We must unite our entire nation with one single strong leader, and we will have to do this under a single flag that will make our people strong spiritually and physically. Our people will no longer suffer from those in power who represent the interests of the minority. Our leader, Vladimir Gil, will now represent the interests of the majority, all of our people.

During the time they dragged him to this place all of Vladimir's arms began to ache in the area of the tendons and joints. Vladimir no longer had any illusions at all about what would be done to him and possibly to his own family. However, he was no longer worried about himself, but only about his family - his daughter Maria, his wife Leonida Georgievna, and, in general, all the people close to him.\n\nUn After he was dragged to the place of execution, he was ordered to stand near the wall. As he walked to the wall he saw several more of his associates. Some were sorry that it had happened this way, some even wept in front of the former King himself that it had happened this way. But most were certain that this was not the end of the fight.\n\n\n\n- Forgive me, my King... - Said one of his subordinates, clearly weeping.\n\n\n\n- Silence! - Suddenly interrupted by the officer's rough, slightly hoarse voice. - Listen to my command! Vladimir and the others looked in the direction of the officer and the soldiers, who were standing there with automatic rifles. The former Tsar saw among all these soldiers a couple of those who had the uniform of the Vyatka principality. Seeing this, he was annoyed that some of the soldiers of his imperial army had gone over to the side of Gil, the new Mladorosses. As it turned out, not everyone was so loyal to the Tsar. Now what? Where is this king? He stands right in front of them, but he means nothing to them anymore.\n\nIn the name of the state of Berezniki - the officer began to read out loud and clear - and by the order of Vladimir Gil himself I order:- First, in respect of Vladimir III Kirillovich Romanov, Tsar of Vyatka, representative of the Romanov Imperial House, to carry out the highest punishment - execution for betraying the Russian people and murder of our leader Alexander Sergeyevich Kazem-Bek!\n\nSecond, in relation to the former government of the Duchy of Vyatka, for aiding and abetting the Nazi occupiers and supporting treason against the Russian people, to carry out the highest punishment, the firing squad! \n\nThird, in relation to the family of Vladimir III Kirillovich Romanov, to put under house arrest with the possibility of their redemption. In the name of all Russian people the Romanovs will never, ever again, encroach upon the authority of our people. Two seconds later the command was given: "Fire!

Even if he said that he was Russian, it would not clear him of suspicion; after all, "Aryans" are also Russians. Any appeal to rank would not help the man in the nightgown either. Finally he made up his mind and said: - My name is Igor Nikiforov and I command a division of the Berezniki People's Army and we have come to free you. - Indeed.

He had not been heard from since the Komi ceased to exist as a separate state, and now it is not clear where he is - whether he hid, or died, or something else.Remembering the reports of his subordinates - from Belozersky, from internal security, he found some connection here - it could all be the work of Sergei Taboritsky himself. However, how can this be verified and confirmed? Is it possible that none of this is actually connected in principle? Nevertheless, something must be done about it. We must talk it all over with Kazem-Bek, and Alexei Kosygin-Romanov made this attempt. Trying to explain his position, Alexander only grinned. - Have you lost your head?

Having learned that Sergei will not be in touch in the near future, apparently due to the Vyatka Congress, Gil had to act almost alone, but at the same time, he received carte blanche to almost any action.\n\nInVladimir Gil sat in his headquarters, watching the map, where were signs of where his squads are in certain places. Suddenly a squad of operatives came to his headquarters and had a suspicious visitor.\n\n\n\nComrade Commander, allow me to report. - The subordinate began.\n\n- Report. - Vladimir Gil said dryly.We found this man by footprints and with the help of dogs. Our search led us to this man who is probably the robber of the warehouse. He had a gun and there were five other people with him. The others ran away with their tails up their asses, and we caught this one and tied him up.\n\n\n\n- Well, well... - Vladimir Gil said in amazement. After that, the commander began to examine this strange man, who was dressed in very simple clothes for that area: pants, shirt, dirty boots, and a face with irregular features was clearly evil. From the feel of it, one could assume that this was the same man who had robbed the warehouse, as he had no sense of innocence, judging by his face. After this inspection Gil gave out the following: - Will you find the others? Yes, sir. For now, I ask that you send him to the interrogation chamber. Tell the other squads to keep searching for the bandits. Yes, sir. Vladimir Gil and his men have sent this suspect to the interrogation chamber. Gil decided to do the interrogation himself. Say your name. - Vladimir Gil began.\n\n\n\n- I don't want to talk. - Said the stranger in his slightly hoarse voice.Tell me your name! - Gil said loudly in response to such an impertinent response.The stranger tried to spit in Gil's face, but it hit him in the chest. Gil immediately swung his fist around and punched the man in the face. The blow was so hard that you could even hear his neck crunch, but it didn't break his spine. Soon blood flowed from this stranger's tooth.\n\nIn an attempt to say something, this stranger, trying to endure the pain of saying his name and last name clearly, said: - "Leonid Brown...

Ordinary terrorists are also part of this organization. In general - if not all, then the bulk of those who were simply negatively disposed towards the government.\n\nIn fact, there are a lot of people, and a lot of material resources too. The idea, the most important component of this organization, was just as strong. In any case, it suited many people. Taboritsky felt he had real power in his hands, which was felt in his liveliness of spirit. His running eyes were looking at the map of Western Russia so greedily that he seemed to want to study it as fast as possible and to remember everything in the smallest detail, but in fact he just wanted to understand where and what forces were under his control.{n\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the news that the Mladoross congress would be prepared in Vyatka, he realized - time could not be delayed any longer. It is necessary to assert themselves as a real force that can overthrow the Judo-Bolshevik Kosygin, Kazem-Bek, Belozersky and all their heads. It's time for real action, and so Sergei Taboritsky called to him all his main top, which has strings almost all over Russia.\n\n\n\n friends, - began Taboritsky, - Soon we will deliver a crushing blow to Judo-Bolshevism, which crept up on us under the mask of true monarchy with the face of Alexei Nikolayevich himself! Now we can not delay, soon their congress will begin, which they will not have time to start - we will kill them faster than they will finish their speech! We shall strike such a blow in one blow, thanks to which Russia will be only grateful to us. We haven't been able to remove the tumor of Judeo-Bolshevism completely. Now this tumor has grown again, and is now sucking all the vitality out of Russia.

On both sides of the road stood multiple guards dressed in ceremonial uniforms who, like a living fence, separated the road from the crowd of people who were waiting to hear the announcement of the Vyatka Congress. The agitation and propaganda in the newspapers created enough information flow to make the population fully aware of the upcoming event and understand how important it was. Besides, it created a generally positive perception of Mladorosses among the population, so that the population not only came to the rally in honor of Kazem-Bek and others, but also was sincerely excited about their arrival.\n\nIn the building itself prominent party figures were already gathering and waiting for the congress to start. The only thing left to do was to wait for Alexei II Kosygin-Romanov to announce it. Many of them were already eager to get down to work, and some of them even started early, discussing with other party members about problems in the country - problems in the economy, political problems, problems of society...{\n\nThe car stopped in front of the entrance to the building by the doorway. Kazem-Bek was the first to come out of the front door, and people were immediately happy to see him. The second to emerge was Sergei Belozersky who was also showered with joyful shouts. Kosygin-Romanov, whose exclamations of joy at his appearance were, perhaps, the loudest, came out the third. Kosygin paused briefly to look around at this huge crowd, which had multiple banners, portraits of Alexei Romanov, and so on, which were clearly aimed at supporting this man. For a while, Alexei Kosygin-Romanov even calmed down and began to climb up behind Kazem-bek and Belozersky.\n\nIn the upstairs, they went to a pedestal, where tables were prepared for speakers with microphones. Kazem-Bek and Belozersky were the first to stand, and Alexei Kosygin-Romanov sat behind them. The speeches of these two leaders began, and Kosygin-Romanov simply sat and waited until they finished their main part.

Apparently so. In the time that had passed, his face had become scarred everywhere, from broken lips and eyebrows to even the broken teeth of this pseudo-Aryan.You know, Comrade Commander," Leonid Brown began to say, as if to tease this man, "y-you know how to treat women.\n\n\n\nGil after that hit the man once again with such force that he flew away together with the chair by one meter, and he fell on the cold, but blood-soaked floor. However, this did not stop Vladimir Gil, and he started kicking this man, first in the head, smashing his nose, and then in the stomach. His nose was bleeding again. How had he not fainted yet? After a series of such harsh blows, Vladimir Gil grabbed the man who was already moaning in pain, still trying to breathe through his bleeding nose by the scruff of his neck and put him back on the chair.Whom do you work for? - Gil asked a very simple and direct question.\n\no... N-No... N-No Throne... Barely answered the prisoner.\n\nN- WHO ARE YOU?!\n\nN-Taboritsky... Sergei Taboritsky.\n\noWith this phrase Vladimir's rage began to fade, he became calmer.\n\nWhat's the purpose of the organization? To kill all of you! What else can you say?

Many of you. The city will be overrun by us, you dirty Russian... Before he could finish that sentence, Gil struck this Leonid in the face again, but clearly at half-strength.

They require no cord, but they are at the same time very powerful and reliable enough to surely destroy the desired target. At the same time, it's expensive - so the "Thrones" have only 1 chance to guarantee the killing of the entire Mladoross top brass.{n\n\nbspThe Throne's men have taken their positions. Taboritsky's men are extremely determined about their plans - they intend to seize the entire city, if only to prevent Kosygin, Belozersky, and Kazem-bek from escaping from the city.

Losing consciousness immediately, the guards quickly and decisively rushed to save those who could still be saved. Having found the bodies of Kazem-Bek and Belozersky, the guards decided to take them back too. The bodies had been hit by multiple shrapnel, part of a leg was missing and some of the shrapnel had entered the skull. How did Kosygin not get hit? It is only by miracle that this can be explained. The crowd immediately started scattering like ants all over the place in different directions. Hidden units of the "throne" crawled out of hiding, armed with automatic weapons and attacking the scattered small groups of guards. Trying to organize a defense, the main defense was built around the Congress building. From the radio, the defenses were also built along the main streets, managing to occupy the housing estates. Taboritsky's storm troopers are not only killing Mlado's soldiers but also civilians, because they can't tell the difference between them.\n\n\n\nKosygin was put on a couch deep inside the building, where there is no chance of catching him, while the defenders of the building defend themselves with their last breath.

Drops of blood were everywhere he looked. The groans of the soldiers from their wounds made Kosygin feel very sorry for them, but there was little he could do to help them. He did not know what had happened to Kazem-Bek and Belozersky, and he wanted to find them. Dead. The 2 corpses, almost ugly in appearance, had glassy eyes, pale skin, and blood that was spreading around them. Kosygin, who had previously looked at the whole affair with a certain disdain, looked at the corpses of his former comrades with mixed feelings. Either he was extremely uncomfortable about it, or he was even glad that at last there was no one to threaten with his demands, or he thought he might weep at the loss of his loved ones. Finally, a final wave of emotion came over him--hate and lust for revenge. He knows perfectly well who did it. We have survived this day, and now we need to fight back. Kosygin swore to them, at least mentally, that they would be avenged, by all means.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, after a brief mourning for his fallen comrades, Kosygin went outside and saw a terrible picture: as it turns out, the pedestal, the place where the speech took place, was blown up, and in the street were dead civilians, many still even alive, but not nearly moving. The characteristic uniform of Taboritsky's stormtroopers Kosygin immediately identified, and he knew it was his doing. It was just as he had surmised - Taboritsky had not forgotten him, and would not leave him alone until he had killed Alexei Kosygin-Romanov.\n\n\n\nIn a few minutes Vladimir Gil arrived in his armored vehicle, he came out of the building and looked for his comrades. But as soon as he got to the right floor of the Congress building and saw that Belozersky and Kazem-bek had been killed, he did not have time to express any emotion and saw Alexey Kosygin trailing behind him. Approaching him, a conversation ensued.\n\n\n\n- My Tsar, - Vladimir Gil began, trying to put together some adequate sentence, - \n\nthe "Prestolniks\n\n" have been destroyed in Vyatka. The city is under our control again.\n\n- That's perfect. - Kosygin replied. - I assume it was your troops who came to Vyatka to protect us? We heard from the prisoner that an attack on all of you was being prepared. On behalf of all Russia, I'd like to thank you very much for your independence, courage and determination in defending our country. I serve Russia! Besides, I want to appoint you Minister of the Armed Forces. Do you accept? Yes, I do. I'll take the job. Fine. From now on, you are the Minister of the Armed Forces, and my first order of business is to deal with these people. What do they call themselves?

This gold would benefit our country and our people, but it would not allow us to recoup all the losses of the Russians in this war, which our people did not need so far away from our homeland. Nevertheless, it was an order from the Tsar himself to fight on the other side of the world. \n\nAfter a while, when the gold was about to be loaded, a car with a man carrying a box wrapped in black velvet drove up to the plane. \n\nThe interpreter, who was with the soldiers, began to translate for the Russians what this parliamentarian was saying: \n\n\n\n- He says that this is a personal gift from our Sultan to your Tsar Sergei Belozersky.

Naturally, an inclination to the images of wide deserts of wise sages shown in OFN shows might be the first choice, or perhaps the prosperous young partner the Italian government propagates. In truth however, only half of those stand true in the Eygpt of the past, and even less so in the Eygpt of today. \n\nThe Eygpt of today is an anomaly—one that shattered all preassumptions I have, even those that I gained on an educated basis: throughout, it seems as if the nation's very soul of spirit is slowly being butchered as I walked through it to my destination, the barbaric-looking guide besides me speaking ever so triumphantly of their so-called "victories" against the other competitors for Eypgt-all of whom looking more preferrable to them at any point. I see in his eyes however, that just like me, he holds contempt, presumably to myself and my "decandent" Orthodox faith, and my goal of visit: a goal he certainly holds too." \n\n"...no, no. The visit of Eygpt is certainly not one done in goodwill or similarity, but one done by admittedly two cunning sides: my Empire, personally intent on locking the eagle's talons around the middle east as the sovereign assertion of it's might, and the eygptian fanatics so desperate to gain recognition internationally against Italian reprisal and manipulate our nation to their benefit, they ever-so-hoped." \n\n"All in all, I admit that conditions were horrid. The talks began in a run-down govermnment Ibuilding where I and my aides are conditioned to feel threatened by the guns and rifles their people took around, our wary eyes seemingly can't completely focus on the him (Sayyid Qutb), charismatic as he tries to be-it can perhaps be seen why such a vile man can succeed in their civil war. Nonetheless, me and my comrades managed to push forward and got ourselves a quite beneficial deal on our side, playing their desperation to our benefit. Those were tense moments, and some of us certainly believed we will not get out alive— atleast in one piece." \n\n"Personally? I wouldn't want to step foot in such an illogical land again, a land where all it's leaders stand delusionally thinking that God, not the strive of man, will solve all their problems had they done his words to the most extreme. Aside from the pity I felt to the common peoples of Eygpt, I felt-still feel some shame for myself and my nation to even dare to extend an olive branch to terrorists I the first place.""

Afterall, being the tsar is no easy task, and so is governing one of the largest nations of the world with such cold climates. Overall, he finds such a duty a good respite from his responsibilities as Tsar, considering it a holiday despite still being technically in his realm of duties as the Tsar. \n\nAs the plane slowly lowers on the runway, he recalled his mission; his target is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the rich nation-state that stands proudly on the Arabian peninsula. Having weathered the challenges of the 20th century, Saudi Arabia is a lucrative oppurtunity for oil and influence crutial to the russian state, an oppurtunity he is trusted with securing. As the door opens to the hot arabian wind, he can't help but feel anticipation, walking down the stairs to meet his middle eastern counterpart before being led to his temporary residence there. Eyeing the projects along the way, he cannot help but feel envy in to contrast to the much more run-down conditions of Russia, but such only strenghtened his resolve. The negotiations coming forward tommorow will be tiring—but also rewarding—travelling from the capital in Riyadh all the way to the holy lands of Mecca and Medina, talks done in multiple locations throughout. While well aware that the Saudis will try to influence the deal to their side through mighty bombastic displays, the Tsar is not weak-willed person himself.

As it is, his fellow compatriots have done a great job at setting up the place, preparing a welcome most worthy of those that have helped their noble struggle to statehood and even reverse the roles of oppression-the Russians. As he eyes the watch on his wrist, a radio from air control notifies him of the arriving delegate: the small plane can be seen on the horizon, it's shadows contrasting the rising sun on the background as it's landing gear slowly retracts, landing the plane smoothly on the runway. What followed happened just as planned; the stairway is quickly pulled to the plane's doorway as it stops before the carpetry, with the Russian delegates soon going down the stairs to the cheers of the stationed crowds. As both sides soon stand on solid ground saluting to their anthems respectfully, Dilwa carefully analyses the stoic expression of the Russian delegates, trying to decipher their thoughts, intentions, or feelings that may influence the negotiations forwardto little avail-before resuming his duties afterwards, guiding the two men into the waiting motorcade while he occupies his thoughts with curiosity, apologizing that his superiors cannot arrive due to the busyness of running their newly-aquired extensive territory. The motorcade would go onward, and Dilwa would be left with the task of cleaning the premises, hoping the best of the negotiations to come. \n\nIt has been but a few days since, yet it feels so long for the government employee at the ministry of foreign affairs, him having placed a personal interest ever since. Taking in any bit of information he can between his work, Dilwa now rests easy in his home and, starting his short holiday as reads through the resolution on a newspaper he had brought just that day.

A cradle of civilization by it's own right, the walls of the city has overseen the lives of men countless; their lives, deaths, and aspirations collectively leaving a mark on the city, a city which is due to see some more in such days of strife, yet to be over irregardless. \n\nBaghdad has been a spot of vying and legitimacy for each of the Iraqi splinter states in their disastorous civil war, seeing the city as a vital key of legitimacy. To this, each side has invested massively to either the capture of defense of the city, with minefields, military caches, agitators, propagandists, and agents. The first two is but a problem of skill, but the latter three still possess a threat as large as it is to any other side of the civil war, speading disinformation, wrecking terror attacks, and threatening the stability of state in the occupation of Iraq as a whole. Deeming the threat to be too much of a risk, action has finally be authorized under the famed "Jackal of Iraq", Vladimir Zhirinovsky. \n\n"Change of plans-groups [one] and [five] sweep downtown, while Groups [three] and [eight] go through the main entrance. Group [six] and [ten] will follow me-the rest, stay to the planned routes. Remember, they're due to die anyways." \n\nTo admit, Zhirinovsky finds himself tired to have speak at greater volumes through the microphone, not helped by the turning rotors on his chopper that simply outscreams him everytime. Recieving confirmation however, the man gave a satisfied exhale as the chopper slowly approached on their drop-zone, noticing other helicopters straying away to help "clean" other parts of the city-they are far away from base now, certainly. \n\nAs the chopper slowly settle on the sanded cushions below, Zhirinovsky and his groups stepped down, rifles held tight in hand. Their first target of the day would be a Ba'athist agitator, having been spotted and confirmed in location by Tsarist spies a few days ago, his face made sure to have been noted by all the men as they approach their target. Soon deemed clear for entry, Zhirinovsky led his men in, sweeping the lower floor to no avail, before going upstairs to encounter a man laying helplessly behind an open windowsill, his legs certainly having betrayed him in fear. Despite his claims of ignorance, his face matched the records, and he is soon put out of his misery. \n\nHe sighed for the second time of the day. The others won't be so easy, and certainly he will lose a fair share of men from his side too. Hearing gunshots ring out through the horizon, he quickly ordered his groups to continue on move; their presence would've been noticed now, and they still have a number of names to check out."

Yet, even within such a bussiness one place stands out more than another, a place now swarmed with all manners of reporters, while protected from all sides by the best bodyguards the nation and money could offer; a place that will nominally be a simple highclass hotel, now the landmark where the fate of Iraq will be charted, a place of civilized negotiation whose values and goals will be uphold in history books throughout all time. \n\nOne by one the players of history appear; Saddam Hussein, the hero of millions, arrives first in his protected limousine. Giving an inspiring speech, the man called for peace and unity not only in Iraq, but through the middle east and the world aswell. "The times of war are behind us, and we must do all we can to not let it stand before us again", he said, to the cheers of crowds and acclaim of observers, giving respect to the crowd before going into the hotel. Next would come notable yet overall faceless people; regional delegates, heads of government, opposing ideologues, and Russian mediators, all of them passing short remarks and giving respects, but none striking as deep as Hussein's. \n\nAnd so it begins, the negotiations. While many would speculate on it's results, no definite information can be verifiably confirmed to have leaked out of the hotel. Some claimed the negotiations fell through, others claim it was salvageable, and yet, when the time finally came, the Mosul Declaration absolutely stunned all, silencing both supporters and oppositions to such a joyous event unfolding; atlast, after so long, people's lifelihoods will be restored, families reunited, and an entire nation under a banner of healing together. The sun seems to shine brighter, and the world seems to stand still in joy, even if only for awhile. Perhaps all those lost lifes will amount to something, afterall."

POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ZHIRINOVSKY_DESC:0 "Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky, a career officer from Kazakhstan, was in the right place at the right time. Having risen through the ranks of the "volunteer brigades" fighting on the side of the Iraqi Kurds, it was he who led the group which was ordered to take direct control of Baghdad, after which he unexpectedly became the head of the Russian colony proclaimed by Tsar Belozersky. \n\now the Zhirinovsky regime is threatened by Islamists, Baathists and other radicals of all sorts, but they don't scare this loyal follower of liberal-democratic ideas. His incredible charisma and incendiary speeches are already legendary, and many believe that he is personally ready to stand bayonet to bayonet with the enemy shouting "Don't you dare shoot at Baghdad!"

POLITICS_SADDAM_HUSSEIN_DESC:0 "Few could have expected that Saddam Hussein, a juvenile criminal, a starving poor man, a child with no future, would prove to be Iraq's most popular politician. His hardship and rise only for the sake of greater hardship repeated the path of his homeland. He overcame poverty, overcame his father's regressive ideas, and began life as a petty clerk in the capital, holding the position of assistant to yet another licker of the Italian boot. He was not happy about it, but this paltry income helped him to adjust to a rapidly changing world. Then he began to write books, read Western humanists, and his name travelled the length and breadth of the country. \n\nThen war came, but Saddam saw it as an opportunity, not a disaster. He left Baghdad, crossed the front line and fled to the Kurds, where he quickly became the host of a local radio station, boosting the morale of his comrades and feeding anti-government and anti-Ba'athist movements in the enemy camp. His voice became the hope of millions. After the war, it became clear who would win the first elections, and which politician the Russian benefactors of free Iraq were betting on."

His family's hopes fell to dust with the defeat of the Soviet Union, and his father miraculously survived the meat grinder of the Russian interregnum. Rutskoi had to learn early how to use a machine gun, so his abilities were quickly recognized by the field commander he served. "Mad Sanya," the captain of the mercenary squad, fought not for the idea, but for whoever paid the most. That changed, however, when his boys met Belozersky's professional troops in the final war to unite all of Russia. After several tribunals and a candid confession, he enlisted in the tsarist army, where he found himself just as much in demand. \n\nNow, with the personal permission of Tsar Belozersky, the soldier of a thousand wars found his rest as the organizer of Russian order in the Turkestan steppes."

 berez_belozerski.39.t:0 "The last battle of the Black League"
 berez_belozerski.39.d:0 "The Black League unit spent all night preparing positions in order to defend against the Mladorosses. Trenches were dug, and reserve lines of defense were prepared to be activated when needed. The last line of defense of the Black League was not far from the bank of the Irtysh - there was a command post. The cadets, who were still in training schools, carried out the work strictly as a textbook, but also created their own billets in order to strike a surprise blow. The T-34-85 took a favorable position for firing from convenient positions - it could not be deliberately sent into battle because its armor was not enough to fight other tanks of the enemy. \nNow, from the binoculars, the Mladoros were detected. They knew they would have the most serious unit against them, so they did not act as guerrilla squads, but as an army. The cadets were surprised at how coherently the troops of the "general czar" attacked. And that amazement was replaced by shock when artillery strikes were heard in the forest. A hail of shells fell on the defenders of this forest, and the troops of the first line of defense had to retreat with losses.nWhen the Mladorosses entered the forest, they continued to advance without stopping and destroyed those units that were still in position. It was a hard battle in the woods, where the black Leaguers showed all the anger and hatred of their enemies. Only spirit determined whether a fighter would survive or not. But no matter what, the Mladorosses squeezed through the enemy defenses. Only a few, the few whose spirits were broken, surrendered at the mercy of the Tsarist Alliance troops. \nT-34-85s, which were in a good position, finally began to show their full firepower. Having knocked out several of the light vehicles, it was supposed to start changing positions, but the RPG-7 hit the turret of the tank. The small amount of ammunition in his possession was detonated. This also detonated the fuel tanks, which ignited the tank. You could hear the tank crews screaming in pain as they burned alive. The tank, laden with additional camouflage such as branches and bushes began to burn, and with it the camouflage it was wearing. Eventually, the size of the flames grew to unbelievable proportions, igniting the trees and starting a forest fire. While all this was going on, the Mladorossian troops were digging deeper and deeper into the Black League defenses until they reached the command headquarters in the same way. Lazarenko and his last soldiers were preparing to take the last battle. To die from the smoke of fire is perhaps one of the ignominious deaths for the Black League, so the decision was made to launch a counterattack by all available forces against the Mladorosses. \Lazarenko and his last soldiers rose at full height with the Black League banner in their hands and, to the deafening cry of "Hurrah!", went into hand-to-hand combat with machine guns, knives, and spades against the superior Mladorossian forces. The flag bearer caught his banner in the forest fire and his banner began to catch fire. Later, during the attack, this same man died, falling, and his half-burned flag fell to the ground. It's a sad ending for the Black League. \nLazarenko and his fighters died showing high courage and bravery in the course of the battle, all of them dead. They nevertheless deserve to be buried with honors. "
